Abstract  
 
This article explores the dynamic influence of computational entities based on multi -agent systems 
theory (SMA) combined with large language models (LLM), which are characterized by their ability 
to simulate complex human interactions, as a possibility to revolutionize  human user interaction 
from the use of specialized artificial agents to support everything from operational organizational 
processes to strategic decision making based on applied knowledge and human orchestration.  
Previous investigations reveal that there  are limitations, particularly in the autonomous approach 
of artificial  agents, especially when dealing with new challenges and pragmatic tasks such as 
inducing logical reasoning and problem solving. It is also considered that traditional techniques, 
such as the stimulation of chains of thoughts, require explicit human guidan ce. In our approach we 
employ agents developed from large language models (LLM), each with distinct prototyping that 
considers behavioral elements, driven by strategies that stimulate t he generation of knowledge 
based on the use case proposed in the scenario (role -play) business, using a discussion approach 
between agents (guided conversation). We demonstrate the potential of developing agents useful 
for organizational strategies, based on multi -agent system theories (SMA) and innovative uses 
based on large language models (LLM based), offering a differentiated and adaptable experiment 
to different applications, complexities, domains, and capabilities from LLM.

1 Introduction   
 
Large Language Models (LLM) brought undeniable advancement to the area of Artificial Intelligence 
(AI), revolutionizing the software industry, especially in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP).  
LLMs have demonstrated extraordinary abilities beyond known text generation capabilities. One of the 
highly sophisticated capabilities is the ability of these models to systemically understand the underlying 
structures of written language, extending their usefulness to tasks ranging from comprehensible text 
generation to understanding programming code  (Chen et al., 2021; Schick & Schütze, n.d.) . 
Studies highlight the exceptional proficiencies of LLMs in natural language processing (NLP) domains, 
which have the possibility of revolutionizing the potential of human -machine interaction using specialized 
virtual assistants (Rasal & Hauer, 2024)  and supporting everything from operational processes to executive 
decision -making based on knowledge and human orchestration are redefining collaborative boundaries in 
organizations.  
These abilities open a new path to exploring the dynamic influence of multi -agent systems (SMA), which 
can rely on artificial intelligence (AI) tools, specifically large language models (LLM), which offer extensive 
opportunities for exploration and applica tions. (Cheng et al., 2024)  in modern organizational models, 
extracting high potential from Generative AI.  
In our approach we employ agents developed from large language models (LLM), each with distinct 
prototyping that considers behavioral elements, driven by strategies that stimulate the generation of 
knowledge based on the use case proposed in the scenario ( role-play). business, using a human -guided 
discussion approach between agents . Our approach demonstrates the potential for developing 
metahumans useful in organizational strategies, based on theories and principles from the field of study 
on multi -agent sy stems (SMA) combined with innovative uses based on large language models (LLM based), 
offering a differentiated experiment and adaptable to various organizational challenges in a controlled 
cyber environment.  Since the different organizational models follow different structures, hierarchies,  and 2  management styles, they present complexities from the behavioral point of view of human beings and 
organizational culture (Langton, 2019) . It is understood that with the evolution of AI, numerous aspects of 
organizational behavior are being changed, as well as perceptions, attitudes, levels of job satisfaction, 
motivation, the way groups and teams will interact and work, communication is one of the factors that will 
undergo changes important with the advent of AI above all, in addition to factors such as organizational 
culture and ethics.  
SMAs or Multi -Agent Systems, a sub -area of Distributed Artificial Intelligence (IAD), play a fundamental 
role in the modernization of organizational processes and countless productive processes in human life. 
These systems are composed of autonomous agents , which can be software or robots, cooperating or 
competing to solve complex problems or perform tasks. They are particularly useful in environments where 
centralization of control and data processing is not viable or efficient (Wooldridge, 2009) . 
A practical example of the use of SMAs in organizations is in supply chain management. Here, different 
agents represent elements such as suppliers, distributors, and customers. They interact autonomously to 
optimize product flow, adjust production based on  demand and minimize costs (Timm et al., 2003) . 
When integrated with large general -purpose language models (LLMs) such as GPT -3 and GPT -4 
(OpenAI), Large (Mistral), Llama2 (Meta), and Gemini Pro (Google), SMAs gain an additional layer of 
capability analytical and decision -making. LLMs can process and an alyze large volumes of textual data, 
which is crucial for understanding market trends, customer sentiment and making strategic decisions. This 
combination can be especially useful in areas such as customer service, where intelligent agents equipped 
with LL Ms can provide quick and accurate responses, improving customer satisfaction  (Brown et al., 2020) . 
Furthermore, integration between LLMs and SMAs in corporate environments can facilitate the analysis 
of unstructured data, such as emails, reports, and social media posts, allowing a more comprehensive and 
detailed view of the business environment. This can lead to more accurate insights and identification of 
emerging opportunities and risks  (Devlin et al., 2019) . 
In this article we propose an LLM -based SMA approach as drivers of the development of intelligent 
agents that can act as meta -humans and these can be used for representations that can consider behaviors, 
functions, develop tasks with a high level of comple xity and be, led and orchestrated by human beings, 
having the potential for customization and adaptability in different use cases that involve conducting 
organizational business internally and externally, with high scalability using the potential of the cl oud, 
collaboration and dynamics where agents can collaborate in an adaptive way taking advantage of the 
machine learning capabilities, adaptation and use of LLMs parameters in real time.  
Agents developed from large language models (LLMs) can interact with human actors at all 
organizational levels from operations to strategy, supporting executives in informed decision making, 
organizational learning, innovation, increasing creativity as wel l as reinforcing of organizational identity, 
seeking an internal balance between competition and collaboration between employees (Humans and 
meta -humans).  
The proposed agents will be customized, refined and trained (not limited to the present study) based 
on the proposed representative use case, considering behavioral aspects that may touch on the concepts 
of “Jungian ” psychoanalysis, where (1) archetypes  that represent ideas, concepts or characters that have 
timeless appeal and resonate deeply with universal human experiences, however, archetypes do not have 
fixed or pre -defined forms  (Jung, 2014a) . 
And the (2) personas, which is the psychic instance responsible for the interaction between the being 
and the community in general  (Jung, 2014b) , in theatrical or colloquial use, it is a social role or character 
played by an actor or persona developed with a focus on improving sales capabilities through the efficient 
design of the types of buyers of the organization's products and services based on the understanding of 
needs, desires and behaviors of cus tomers to develop more targeted marketing strategies  (Revella, 2015) . 
Personas can also represent target users (Cooper et al., 2014) , or as “fictitious, specific and concrete 
representations of target users”  (J. Pruitt & T. Adlin, 2006) . 
According to  (Cooper et al., 2014) , A persona can represent a group of target users who share common 
behavioral characteristics, needs, and goals, written in the form of a detailed narrative about a specific, 
fictional person. These details make the persona feel like a real person in the des igners' minds. Thus, by 
using a narrative, image, and name, a persona provides the human -computer interaction professional with 
a vivid, specific design that manufactures the persona to seem like a real person in the designers' minds  
(Miaskiewicz et al., 2008) . The narrative also addresses the persona's goals, needs, and frustrations that 
are relevant to the product or system being designed (Maness et al., 2008) . In (Norman, 2002)  explains that 
in the context of personas, empathy is necessary to allow understanding and identification with the user 
population, to better ensure that they will be able to take advantage of the product or service.  
Empathizing with personas allows the design team to stop talking about the general user when making 
product design decisions.  
This profound shift from talking about users in general to understanding and identifying with personas' 3  needs and goals allows designers to more effectively address users' needs  (Maness et al., 2008) .  
The fact of the relationship between archetype and persona is interesting from a practical point of view 
that considers studies and theories of Carl Gustav Jung's analytical psychology, since this relationship 
resides in the fact that the persona can be unders tood as an expression of the archetype of the “self”. 
social” or “public self”.  
The persona is the way of presenting oneself to the world, and this choice can be influenced by 
archetypes present in the collective unconscious. For example, one might adopt a "hero" archetype in one's 
public life, trying to be courageous and resilient in  all situations. In this case, the hero archetype is 
influencing the persona (extroverted reflective, introverted reflective, introverted perceptive, extroverted 
perceptive), as can also occur with archetypes such as “Explorer”, “Rebel”, “Creator”, “Ruler” , “Shadows ” 
among others (Jung, 2014a) . 
New aspects of interaction create paradigms regarding business interactions  (Huang & Rust, 2018) . It is 
worth noting that unlike traditional and simplistic approaches that develop only individual agents, the 
strategy proposed in this article is dynamic, flexible and will seek to bring useful insights to the next 
generation of organizations driven by da ta, AI and multi -agent systems to transform competition into 
collaboration, bringing a discussion about how AI can increase and improve collective intelligence from the 
point of view of facilitating collaboration and human learning, considering the optim ization and 
aggregation of information effectively (Malone, 2022) . 
Previous investigations reveal that there are limitations, particularly in the autonomous approach of 
agents to new challenges, pragmatic tasks such as inducing logical reasoning and problem solving, it is also 
considered that traditional techniques, such as stimulating chains of thoughts, require human guidance 
explicit (Devlin et al., 2019; Reed et al., 2022) . 
In this experiment, we will employ structured coding to orchestrate a simulated conversation between 
characters, with the purpose of reflecting, through text, the various attributes within a specific context and 
domain.  When understanding these capabilities, it is critical to consider the ethical implications and risks 
associated with using Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as privacy issues, data security, and the possibility of 
algorithmic bias. Therefore, the impleme ntation of these technologies demands  a careful approach, with 
clear policies and protocols to ensure their responsible and ethical use (Russel & Norvig Peter, 2022) . 
Combining these concepts with the potential of AI enables the creative design of artificial  agents, which 
can take the form of "meta -humans". These agents consider the integration of ideas, forms, knowledge,  
and specialties from the real world, such as AI, Computer Science, Software Engineering, Computational 
Linguistics, Data Science, Multi -Agent Systems Theory, Cognitive and Behavioral Psychology, Knowledge 
Management, Design, Organizational Modeling, Ethic s in Artificial Intelligence,  and use of Data.  
In this case study, we will simulate the vision, knowledge and behaviors based on the role called Chief 
Financial Officer (CFO), an experienced persona in financial organizations. This persona will be personified 
as CFO (traditional) and CFO (Bold), perfor ming the designated role -play, which may have defined strategic 
thinking alignments and in line with the organization's strategy and objectives.  
In subsequent sections, we will delve deeper into aspects that demonstrate how LLMs and multi -agent systems 
can reshape the contemporary organizational landscape.  
 
2 Methodology  
2.1 General Approach  
In this session we will cover the main components of the experimental platform that can support the 
development of this case study. This experiment will be developed using LLM (GPT -3.5), considering that 
each of the characters will have a distinct and representative prototype simulated from the proposed use 
case in business role -play scenarios, using a debate strategy to generate knowledge in your answers.  
Note that the platform is not conditioned to the use only of OpenAI's LLM (GPT -3.5), which is flexible 
for the use of other general -purpose technologies such as GPT -4 (OpenAI), Large (Mistral), Llama2 (Meta) 
and Gemini Pro (Google).  
The case study will be aimed at the financial industry , using a simulated challenge in a reduced format 
(business role play), the construction of the characters considers the role known as Chief Financial Officer 
(CFO). The research, “In the face of volatility, CFOs —and their organizations —adapt” , conducted by 
Mckinsey consultancy in 2023, was used as inspiration for developing the context of the case study.  
To direct this and future studies, a descriptive macro of the components of the architectural framework 
of the experimental platform under development.  
 4  Multiagent  Data & AI Based Platform - Overview  
 
The proposed framework (see figure 1) is a reference considering the components of (C1 -C14) and will be 
used to refer to the various components and concepts used in this and future studies. When dealing with topics with 
great scope, such as multi -agent sys tems (SMA), Artificial Intelligence (AI), large language models (LLMs), the figure 
below (figure 1) is not intended to be an exhaustive model and will be referenced in the paragraphs below by its 
components (e.g. C1: Data; C4: Embedding Model).  
 
 
Figure  1: Representation of the main components of the framework  
 
2.1.1  C1 – Data ( General Point of View ) 
It is evident that a detailed understanding of the business processes, roles, and behaviors to be 
represented digitally are important, highlighting the need to understand the data inherent to the 
representations and development of the platform, which will be data driven.  
The acquisition of classified and high -quality data are highly relevant factors for the orchestration of 
agents to occur effectively and close to the reality expected in a simulation.  
Data quality is one of the main challenges when dealing with different formats and types of data, and 
these are essential requirements. Especially historical, contextual data, or special specifications that 
depend on the type of business process, persona, and function to be built, such data can prove to be 
complex as it can reside in different media such as proprietary platforms, third -party platforms, API's, 
varied formats and even image documents. How was the development of the BlombergGPT model (Wu et 
al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) , who achieved impressive results by capitalizing on exclusive access to 
specialized data to train large language models specifically in finance.  
This highlights the need to use a data -centric  approach, use of engineering protocols, data quality, and 
training requiring high expertise in engineering, and data governance. In this sense, we believe it is 
necessary to highlight the architectural layers prior to the proposed framework (see figure 1) , as follows : 
▪ Data Source Layer:  This layer largely represents the data necessary to build the archetypes, 
personas, behaviors, demographic data, psychographic characteristics, behaviors, needs, 
objectives, experiences, knowledge, past, professional environment when it comes to the 
metahu man or agent. Otherwise, this is also the layer that will serve as input to capture data about 
the business model and processes inherent to each industry.  
▪ Data Engineering Layer:  This layer addresses the challenge of processing times (extraction, 
5  transformation, and loading), data validity and sensitivity. There are data that have high temporal 
sensitivity and low signal -to-noise ratio.  (Fama, 1970) , especially when considering information 
from the financial industry and market efficiency.  
 
2.1.2  C1 - Data (Financial Services  Point of View)  
Considering the proposed use case and the specialty of the personas, who are experts in the financial 
sector, it is important to highlight the unique characteristics that the data used in this industry presents. In 
this way, our study considers  a data -centric approach, specifically highlighting the application industry.  
Financial sector data originates from a wide variety of sources, types of operations, types of 
transactions, various legacy systems, with unique characteristics such as financial news, discussions 
originating from social media, various announcements about indicators, financial products, among many 
others. These data sources have different characteristics such as : 
▪ Time : Much information is updated opportunistically (as is the case with seasonal and specific 
reports) and has a short validity window as it is captured at moments of interest.  
▪ Dynamism : News and indicators change quickly in response to economic stimuli, unexpected 
movements conditioning the responses of investors, organizations and above all information.  
▪ Influ ence: Information and news have a significant impact on decision -making, finance, and 
financial markets that can lead to sudden movements across the entire financial market, especially 
in assets related to specific investments and products.  
▪ Granularity : Data can be granular into larger and smaller  grain of data  (Kimball & Ross, 2015) , 
relating to the financial situation of an organization, including assets, liabilities, revenue, margin, 
profitability, forecasts, etc.  
Company Financial Records are official documents that can be open to the public, submitted to 
regulators, which can be used to obtain insights into financial success, strategy and these can represent 
important information to define : 
▪ Reliability : Different documents offer information at different granular levels, financial status, 
asset value, revenue, margin, profitability.  
▪ Periodicidade : São informações periódicas para acompanhamento da situação financeira e podem 
ser mensais, semanais, anuais, quartil)  
▪ Impact : There are various announcements and publications that can provide information about 
important impacts on the organization's financial health and that can influence the market, share 
prices, investor, and consumer views.  
Social media : Since economics is not just an exact discipline, social media can reflect different views 
based on feelings that are not mathematically based and can bring variables such as:  
▪ Variability and tensions : Texts described on social networks (discussions and posts) are highly 
variable in tone, content, quality,  and this brings enormous complexities when adopted as a valid 
source of information for certain analyzes . 
▪ Real -time feelings and visions : Social media  can be excellent platforms for capturing real -time data 
that can refer to market “sentiment” over time and can express the “trend” and/or changes in 
“opinion” of users.  
▪ Volatili ty: The data expressed on social networks is highly volatile and notably can be intentionally 
influenced and quickly change responses to events (news and facts), bringing often unexpected 
movements to the market.  
▪ Trends : These are the responses to market movements that are observed in the various 
communication channels typically used by professionals in the financial sector such as Google, 
Financial Teams among many others that may have critical importance on financial market 
movements.  
▪ Perspectiv e: It is the combination of different market perspectives considering the different 
experts who analyze the data and can give investment advice, organizational movements that can 
go in different directions and depend on the informational context of the market . 
▪ Market Sentiment : Writing on these platforms can reflect the feeling of a “collective” about 6  specific topics and sectors or about the market in general, providing valuable information for 
decision -making by organizations and people.  
▪ Coverage range : It is about the scope of information that can cover a product, service, market 
segment in a specific way, limiting analyzes or the opposite.   
It is interesting and challenging to develop agents that can deal with this information where each of the 
data sources, when combined, can provide exclusive insights into the financial world, and bring handling 
complexities (high temporal sensitivity, high  dynamism and low signal -to- noise (SNR). By integrating 
different types of data, properly understood, classified,  and qualified, agents can bring understandings, 
points of view, new questions,  and comprehensive answers to support modern organizations in the 
effective use of data and allow learning both for taking decision -making and executive education.  
 
2.1.3  C2 - Playground  
Represents the integration and/or use of web -based development platforms (OpenAI, HuggingChat, 
Cohere) to experiment, test, deploy code, prompts and/or machine learning models using large language 
models (LLM), designed to accelerate the process of writing , testing and code generation.  
 
2.1.4  C3 - Web App  
It is the WEB -based application layer and/or software hosted on a cloud provider (e.g. Azure Cloud, 
Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform), which demonstrates the potential capacity of using the 
proposed framework considering the potential of large da ta models. language (LLM) directed to this 
channel.  
 
2.1.5  C4 - Embedding Models  
 These are models that can map words or phrases to vectors in a continuous space (these models are 
referenced at coding time), so that semantically similar words are represented by nearby vectors. They 
consist of “tokens” that are treated as resources in your dataset. These models are trained on large 
linguistic datasets to capture contextual and semantic relationships with for example Word2Vec, GloVe 
(Global Vectors for Word Representation), BERT (Bidir ectional Encoder Representations from 
Transformers), OpenAI Ada Embedding 2, Cohere AI.  
 
2.1.6  C5 - Orchestration (SMA, Data & AI  Based)  
In scenarios involving one or multiple agents (Data & AI based) there is a need to orchestrate 
interactions between digital agents combined with human interactions. This orchestration component 
represents a fundamental functionality in managing interactions and coordinating data flow. It is worth 
mentioning that the architecture of multi -agent systems refers to the mult iple use of data and AI including 
specialist LLMs, and this means that they have their own resources such as (embeddings, dictionaries, 
related tables, algorithms, etc.). Below functions provided (not exhaustive) in the orchestration module 
with multiple a gents : 
▪ Command Interpretation : 
▪ The orchestration component must be capable of interpreting commands given by humans to 
start, pause, resume,  or end activities. This would involve analyzing verbalized (use of voice) 
and textual (use of keyboard) instructions.  
▪ Scripting : 
▪ Based on the instructions, the orchestration component scripts actions, determining the 
execution rules, topics, actions, processes,  and functionalities to be executed by the agents.  
▪ Shift Control : 
▪ Ensures a fair and efficient distribution of speaking turns among agents. It could also manage 
each agent's speaking time to keep communication balanced.  
▪ Integration (Systems, Data, Multi -Agent LLMs/Meta -humans …): 
▪ Integration, communication with agents to transmit instructions, collect responses and 
coordinate communication, organize, and govern the information and knowledge generated.  7  ▪ Performance Monitoring:  
▪ Monitors the performance of agents, evaluating relevance, coherence,  and respect for the 
rules of the debate. This may involve analyzing specific metrics generated by language models.  
▪ Generation of Prompts, Questions and Stimulus:  
▪ Based on the context in the instructions, the orchestration component generates questions, 
stimuli or challenges aimed at specific agents to stimulate discussions, propose new ideas, new 
lines of thought to obtain creative forms of collaboration and contri bution with human beings.  
▪ Human Intervention:  
▪ Ability for real -time human intervention to correct misunderstandings, adjust the script or add 
additional information for agents to use.  
▪ Evaluation and feedback:  
▪ After interactions, the orchestration component provides a summary of agents' performance, 
highlighting strengths and areas for improvement.  
 
2.1.7  C6 - APIs/Plugins  
It is the interface that allows interaction between different software and in the context of LLMs, APIs 
can be used to integrate language models into applications, websites,  or services such as OpenAI provides 
an API to access GPT models, allowing developers to easily incorporate the Text generation in your 
applications. Plugins represent additional modules that extend the functionalities of an application and, in 
the case of  LLMs, can be used to integrate Generative AI functionalities into different types of applications.  
 
2.1.8  C7 - LLM & Cache  
It is a component developed to enable a memory manipulation strategy in certain scenarios to 
temporarily store intermediate representations of words or phrases for faster access to previously 
processed information, depending on the type of application.  
 
2.1.9  C8 - Cloud Provider  
It is the cloud computing platform that can offer global hosting services for solutions such as Google 
Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure.  
 
2.1.10  C9 – Data Security & Privacy  
It represents the layer and technological mechanisms responsible for the security and privacy of the 
data used in each use proposition, in accordance with the rules and definitions in (C13) (see Figure 1).  
 
2.1.11  C10 - Cloud DBs  
It represents the usage layer of different types of databases in the cloud, they are data storage services 
that operate to meet different data requirements and have different uses  like (store  data , enable RAG and/ 
or fine-tunning,  Grounding , support data governance  strategies , manage data, knowledge , cache,  and 
metadata ), when  it comes to LLM based solutions.  
▪ Relational databases:  Store data in related tables and can be used to store metadata, train models,  
and maintain structured information about the language and use of solutions.  
▪ NoSQL databases:  They do not follow the previous model, they can be oriented by documents, 
key-value, column,  or graphs and are useful for storing large volumes of unstructured data such as 
long texts, unprocessed texts and can be used for model training.  
▪ Document database : Store data in the form of graphs, with “nodes” representing entities and 
edges representing relationships and can be used to represent complex semantic relationships, 
such as the knowledge structure used in some LLMs.  
▪ Time Series Databases : They are designed to store and retrieve data organized by time stamp or 
time interval and can be useful for storing temporal data that may reflect language changes over 
time.  8  ▪ Vector Databases:  Focused on storing and processing vector data, such as distributed 
representations of words and can be used to store pre -trained embeddings, facilitating quick access 
to semantic representations of words.  
 
2.1.12  C11 – DataOps  
These are the practices, cultures and methods that aim to integrate data, improve collaboration and 
productivity between teams related to data to supply the different models (ML, DL, GenAI) and in turn the 
LLMs, being important for management of the data lifecycle.  
Typically, the team that makes up the DataOps team are data scientists, data engineers, analysts, 
among others. The effectiveness, scalability and quality of the models depend on the DataOps strategy 
implemented. In the context of use for operations based on LLMs DataOps can : 
▪ Increase collaborative efficiency:  Incorporates practices that promote efficient collaboration 
between data teams, from the acquisition to the implementation of language models, such as the 
establishment of processes, communication, knowledge sharing and integration between team 
members.  
▪ Structuring data management and lifecycle:  Involves effective management of the data lifecycle, 
from collection and preparation to training and model deployment. Promotes good practices for 
configurations, implementations, automations (cleaning, transformations) of linguistic data for 
training mod els in data pipelines.  
▪ Workflow automation: Automation of repetitive processes to improve operational efficiency and 
reduce human errors and can be used to use automation tools to automate the execution of model 
training experiments, hyperparameter tuning and performance evaluation.  
▪ Versioning of data and models:  Highly useful for versioning data and models to track changes, 
facilitating the reproduction of experiments and ensuring consistency, they can be used in version 
control systems to track changes in training data sets and models, allowing a consistent anal ysis of 
results.  
▪ Continuous deployment:  DataOps brings practices that enable the efficient and continuous 
deployment of models in production environments. Use techniques such as deploying models in 
containers to facilitate continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) of language model s. 
▪ Performance monitoring:  Implementing systems to continuously monitor (after establishing 
metrics, alerts,  and notifications) the performance of models in production is one of the practices 
foreseen in DataOps.  
▪ Security and compliance:  DataOps provides a guide for adopting practices that guarantee data 
security and adherence to compliance and regulations, such as the implementation of security 
measures with encryption, access control and auditing to protect sensitive data processed by t he 
models.  
 
2.1.13  C12 – MLOps  
MLOps is an ML culture and practice that unifies ML application development (Dev) with ML system 
deployment and operations (Ops). Your organization can use MLOps to automate and standardize 
processes across the entire ML lifecycle, broadly integrated with DataOps practices.  
 
2.1.14  C13 – LLM Ops 
LLMops is not a very common term, and its definitions may be connected to the concept of DataOps 
applied to LLMs (see item 2.1.12). LLMops allows the implementation, monitoring, and adjustments of 
LLMs, which require collaboration between DataOps, data sci ence, DevOps teams, like the strategies 
adopted in MLOps, widely integrated with DataOps practices.  
 
2.1.15  C14 - Data and LLM Governance  
Data governance refers to practices and policies to ensure the quality, integrity, security, and 
compliance of data in an organization. It involves defining guidelines, responsibilities, and processes to 
effectively manage the data used in building the sol ution (organizational level) and involves the points (not 
exhaustive):  9  ▪ Ethics in Language:  
▪ Establish ethical guidelines to ensure that language models do not promote bias, hate speech, 
or discrimination.  
▪ Interpretability and Transparency:  
▪ Require models to be interpretable and transparent in their decisions, especially in critical 
applications.  
▪ Responsible Training:  
▪ Ensure that model training is carried out responsibly, avoiding bias and promoting equity.  
▪ Continuous Monitoring:  
▪ Implement monitoring systems to detect changes in model performance or behavior over time.  
▪ Impact Assessment:  
▪ Conduct impact assessments to understand how models affect users and communities and 
adjust as necessary.  
▪ Data Privacy:  
▪ Adopt measures to protect the privacy of data used in training and ensure compliance with 
privacy regulations.  
 
The proposed structure (see figure 1) aims to demonstrate the potential of a platform developed to build 
artificial minds, based on the theories, principles and techniques presented, demonstrating that human beings can 
orchestrate the agents, personified i n metahumans while  maintains knowledge and control and governance 
possibilities applied to different use cases.  
2.2 Development Strategy  
The development strategy is described below, (see Figure 2) which schematically demonstrates the flow 
that will be used to enable the “conversation” between the two declared artificial  John , classic CFO (Focus 
on capital protection) and Anne , Bold CFO (Focus on Growth).  
As shown in figure 2, in (01) the context considering the economic scenario is inserted via code (see 
Item 2.2.1). In (02) we inserted via code an open question focused on generating knowledge and 
encouraging discussion between the two agents. In (3) there is an open discussion that takes place in  50 
rounds (questions and discursive answers). In (4) there is a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the 
transcription of the conversation between agents 1 and 2.  
 
Figur e 2 - Schematic representation of the data flow and actions of each actor  
We will deliberately use OpenAI's GTP -3.5 technology to illustrate the developments by combining free -
to-use data (web), code developments using the OpenAI playground, use of the Azure cloud manager and 
components (KeyVault), API (OpenAI on Azure)  and Python programming language.  The GPT -3.5 
parameters that are used in this experiment such as vocabulary size, embedding size, temperature, top_p, 
max_tokens, presence_penalty, Frequency_penalty combined with the context prompt engineering 
techniques for generat ing knowledge, resources, configurations, definitions are described in the sessions 
(2.2.3) and (2.2.4) and in the code distributed and highlighted in (2.2.5).  
2.2.1  General Business Context  
We understand that the modern business environment imposes significant challenges on CFOs, 
requiring rapid adaptations to technological, regulatory,  and economic changes. The increasing complexity 
of commercial operations and the need to make quick strategic decisions in search of opportunities and 
competitive advantage have become fundamental aspects for the role of the CFO of financial organizations , 
10  highlighting the critical importance of financial risk management in operations  (Saunders, 2018).  And the 
use of robust analytical approach (Davenport, 2007) , to obtain competitive advantage  taking into account 
generic positioning strategies (Porter, 1980) . 
For this simulation we will highlight the general business context of the scenario:  
▪ Financial Market Volatility:  Global economic uncertainty and changes in financial markets introduce 
significant risks that directly affect financial decisions.  
▪ Intense Competition:  Modern banks, often fintechs, present a competitive threat, requiring CFOs of 
traditional institutions to seek innovations to remain relevant.  
▪ Complex Regulations:  Increasing regulatory complexity poses compliance challenges and requires 
significant investments in systems and processes.  
▪ Efficient Cost Management:  The constant pressure for efficiency and cost reduction requires a strategic 
approach to financial management.  
▪ The use of data and Artificial Intelligence: The strategic use of data has become an imperative for CFOs. 
Collecting, analyzing, and interpreting large data sets can provide valuable insights to guide financial 
decisions. Artificial intelligence, through advanced algorithms, can offer more accurate p redictions, 
identify patterns, and automate processes, alleviating the operational burden.  
The question that Anne  (Bold CFO) will use to start the conversation with John  (Classic CFO) is described below.  
“We, CFOs, are having difficulty adapting to highly volatile economic conditions. But it is important to look for 
innovative ways to maintain growth and profitability. Do you agree?"  
Anne's question directs towards inducing logical reasoning and chain of thought to generate knowledge 
considering CFOs' ability to manage risks, make strategic decisions and implement operational changes to ensure 
business success in a challenging environm ent. 
2.2.2  The Artificial Agents  
 
In this experiment, the imagined archetypes will be based on the role of executives in the real world, 
called Classic CFO and Bold CFO, which do not necessarily represent archetypes in themselves, however in 
this context we will respectively treat this rol e as being the “guardian” of the organization's finances. and 
the “Rebel and revolutionary” who intends to grow the organization’s capital.  
The guardian and the revolutionary rebel are archetypes  (Jung, 2014a) . Let's join the two executives 
(agents) with different styles in a lively conversation about business challenges based on the topic below.  
 
“How CFOs are balancing the need to adapt to volatile economic conditions with maintaining the 
growth and profitability of their organizations. ” 
 
The macro characteristics of our artificial agents are as follows:  
 
Characteristics of the Traditional CFO  
 
Jonh, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Classic, will act as Chief Financial Officer (CFO) with experience in large  
and traditional  financial institutions and has characteristics such as: 
▪ Financial Conservatism:  Tends to adopt a more conservative stance in relation to financial risks. 
Prioritizes stability and security in investment decisions.  
▪ Focus on Compliance:  Places great importance on compliance with accounting regulations and 
standards. Prioritizes legal compliance and seeks to minimize the risks associated with possible 
penalties.  
▪ Conventional Approach to Cost Management:  In cost management, the traditional CFO adopts a 
more conventional approach, seeking efficiency and expense reduction, but generally with a greater 
emphasis on stability than on innovation.  
▪ History -Based Decision Making:  Analyzing historical data is fundamental for the traditional CFO 
when making decisions. Experience and historical patterns are strong influencers in the formulation 11  of financial strategies.  
 
Characteristics of the Bold CFO  
 
Anne, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Capital Rise, will act as Chief Financial Officer (CFO) with experience in 
modern financial institutions (Neo Banks) and Fintechs, her characteristics are:  
▪ Risk Propensity and Innovation: The bold CFO is more inclined to take calculated risks in search of 
growth opportunities. Willing to explore new strategies and innovations to drive financial 
performance.  
▪ Emphasis on Growth Strategies:  Unlike the traditional CFO, the bold CFO places a strong emphasis 
on growth strategies, including more aggressive investments in new markets, emerging technologies, 
and significant expansions.  
▪ Adoption of Disruptive Technologies:  The bold CFO is more open to incorporating disruptive 
technologies, such as artificial intelligence and blockchain, to improve operational efficiency and 
create competitive advantages.  
▪ Greater Flexibility in Cost Strategies: In cost management, the bold CFO can adopt a more flexible 
approach, prioritizing investments that promote innovation and growth, even if this involves a 
temporary increase in costs.  
▪ Intensive Use of Real -Time Data:  Unlike the traditional CFO, the bold CFO intensively uses real -time 
data to guide decisions. Predictive analytics and dynamic data interpretation play a crucial role in 
your strategies.

3 Discussion and Results  
 
The integration of computational entities based on the principles of multi -agent systems (SMA) highlighting 
the autonomy, interdependence, coordination, modeling, simulation,  and distribution possibilities of agents 
(Wooldridge, 2009) . 
Large language models (LLM) that have capabilities for executing multiple tasks are revolutionary in the field 
of natural language processing (NLP), since these models are trained in an unsupervised way on several tasks. 
This approach allows models to lear n rich, generalized language representations  (Brown et al., 2020) . 
These combined features offer a new paradigm for human -machine interaction in the financial industry. Our 
approach focuses on utilizing specialized artificial  to support a wide range of organizational processes, from 
operational to strategic decision making.  
The results of our research demonstrate that this approach has the potential to revolutionize the way 
organizations conduct their activities, providing greater efficiency, precision, and adaptability.  
One of the main contributions of our study is the ability of artificial  developed from large language models to 
simulate complex human interactions. By considering behavioral elements and directing strategies that 
stimulate the generation of knowledge, our agents can perform advanced cognitive tasks, such as problem 
solving a nd logical reasoning.  
This suggests that although there are limitations in the autonomous approach of artificial , the combination 
of SMA with LLM can overcome these limitations, offering a new horizon for human -machine interaction.  
Furthermore, the use of discussion approaches between agents, such as guided conversation, has proven to 
be effective in generating knowledge from simulated business scenarios.  
The use of role -play in a controlled cyber environment provides a dynamic and adaptive means to explore 
diverse organizational situations, allowing agents to learn and evolve in real time.  14  Our results also highlight the potential for developing “metahumans” useful in organizational strategies. By 
empowering artificial  with advanced cognitive skills and guiding them through adaptive strategies, our approach 
offers an innovative solution to organizational challenges in an ever -changing environment, particularly from an 
organizational learning perspective.  
Learning from observing the discussion between actors with complementary views, where interested parties 
can maintain control, with a certain distance while learning. This transforms the analysis of a discussion into an 
attractive way of obtaining knowledg e by bringing diversity of perspectives where in a discussion, different 
points of view and experiences are shared, especially considering areas of knowledge with high similarity as is 
the case of this study, the which can provide a broader and deeper insi ght into a given subject. This allows 
participants to consider aspects that may not have been previously considered.  
Just like in the real world, encouraging the exchange of ideas and opposing arguments, discussion facilitates 
the exchange of ideas between participants, allowing new concepts to be presented and debated. This process 
can lead to creative insights and inno vative solutions to complex problems, identifying strengths and franks of 
each position, enabling the identification of sometimes non -trivial knowledge.  
Highly relevant point is the aspect of collaborative learning, which promotes collaborative learning, where 
participants can benefit from each other, building on each other's ideas and correcting mistaken 
understandings. This creates a dynamic and interact ive learning environment seeking practical applicability for 
each organization.  
Considering the theme, the use of LLM to simulate discussion between agents, personified, we highlight the 
following analyses:  
 
Qualitative Analysis of The Conversation Between Artificial Agents  
 
The transcription of the conversation between the agents presents a structured discussion between two 
personas representing different approaches in the financial area: John, the classic CFO, and Anne, the bold CFO.  
They debate issues such as sustainability, technological innovation, adapting to volatile economic conditions 
and the use of real -time data for decision -making. John tends to emphasize the importance of stability, security,  
and historical data analysis, while Anne highlights the need for adaptability, innovation,  and use of real -time 
data.  
The conversation reflects different perspectives and approaches to the challenges faced by CFOs in the 
financial industry.  
The following table provides a (non -exhaustive) summary of the discussion  between the agents, reinforcing 
the characteristics shaped by the design  (code, parameter s, context , prompt engineering)  of each persona.  
 
 
Table 4 - Conversational Analysis  (Summary)  
Persona  Excerpts Of Conversation  Persona Characteristics  
ANNE  "Absolutely, sustainability initiatives can also lead to 
cost savings through energy efficiency and waste 
reduction, further enhancing the financial performance 
of the organization."  Emphasizes the importance of 
sustainability and financial 
efficiency.  
JOHN  "Indeed, implementing technological innovations can 
help streamline processes, improve efficiency, and 
reduce costs in the long term."  Highlights the importance of 
technological innovation to 
reduce costs.  
ANNE  "Absolutely, leveraging disruptive technologies like 
artificial intelligence and blockchain can provide a 
competitive edge and enhance operational efficiency."  Values the adoption of disruptive 
technologies for competitive 
advantage.  
JOHN  "Indeed, investing in sustainable practices and cost -
effective measures can help mitigate risks and ensure 
long -term profitability despite economic volatility."  Prioritizes sustainable practices 
and cost -effective measures to 
mitigate risks.  
ANNE  "Absolutely, real -time data allows CFOs to quickly 
identify trends and opportunities, enabling them to 
adapt their strategies accordingly in volatile economic 
environments."  Highlights the importance of 
using real -time data for strategic 
adaptation.  15   
The following table provides a frequency analysis , considering each persona, behavior, number of lines, 
main words used that reinforce the positioning of the characters that can be contrasted with the parameters, 
context and descriptions entered via code.  
 
Table 5 - Frequency Analysis  (Summary)  
PERSONA  BEHAVIOR  ROUNDS  KEYWORDS  FREQUENCY ANALYSE  
ANNE  Boldness  30 sustainability, disruptive 
technologies, AI, blockchain, real -
time data, predictive analytics, 
growth, innovation  High frequency of words related to boldness 
and innovation, such as "disruptive 
technologies", "real -time data", "predictive 
analytics".  
JOHN  Conservatism  30 sustainability, historical data, 
stability, security, conservative 
financial approach  High frequency of words related to 
conservatism and stability, such as "historical 
data", "stability", "conservative financial 
approach".  
 
Analysis of the characters' speeches reveals a positive feeling with both personas demonstrating agreement 
and enthusiasm regarding topics such as sustainability, innovation and adaptation to volatile economic conditions, 
topics discussed include sustainab ility, technological innovation, use of real -time data, adaptation to volatile 
economic conditions and strategies to ensure long -term growth and profitability.  
Keywords in the discussion often include sustainability, innovation, efficiency, real -time data, economic 
volatility, long -term strategies, and profitability, with thematic coherence in each persona's speeches, with Anne 
emphasizing the importance of innov ation and rapid adaptation, while John highlights the need for stability and 
historical data analysis.  
Considering convergence and divergence there are areas of convergence between John and Anne's views, 
especially in relation to the importance of sustainability and technological innovation. However, there are also 
divergences regarding approaches to dealin g with economic volatility and the use of real -time data.  
The results of our investigation revealed that the dynamic integration of SMA and LLM -based computational 
entities provides significant potential for improving human -machine interaction. Our artificial  have demonstrated 
skills that can be refined and generate knowledge in different areas, applied in different industries in a few diverse 
use cases.  
4 Limitations  
 
The revolutionary potential that multi -agent systems (SMA), based on large language models (LLM -Based) 
possess, is undeniable and opens doors to creating value in infinite use cases.  
However, given the need for realistic simulation of real -world processes or systems, it is important to 
recognize the (non -exhaustive) and unavoidable limitations that exist in this experimental study, as it is the first in a 
series considering the develop ment of the platform mentioned in this article. document.  
Limited Generalization:  The case study is focused on a specific industry (finance) and specific challenges 
faced by CFOs. This may limit the generalizability of results to other industries or to different functions within 
organizations.  
Character Simplification:  Characters are simplified into archetypes (Classic CFO and Bold CFO), which may 
not fully capture the diversity of profiles found in real CFOs. The complexity of human behavior and interactions 
between executives can be difficult to fully represent in a s imulated scenario.  
The simplified architecture of the agents:  It is still not enough to deal with highly complex tasks considering 
the level of human cognition, although evolution and adaptation for use in different conditions and use cases is 
possible, since the platform aims to become a platform for orchestrating multi -agent systems (SMA), Multi -LLMs 
(LLM -based), has long been developed, especially when dealing with multidimensional environments that interact 
with different data platforms, dif ferent applications, different cloud providers and multifactor parameterization to 
simulate increasingly complex archetypes, personas, behaviors and activities.  
Dependence on Language Models:  The effectiveness of the simulation depends on the ability of language 
models, such as GPT -3.5 (used in this study), to generate realistic and relevant responses to the proposed scenarios. 
However, these models may have limitations in understanding the sp ecific context or providing accurate answers in 
certain situations.  16  Technological and Strategic Limitations:  The experimental platform at this time used technologies that 
limited its capabilities, since GPT -3.5 was used as the main Generative AI engine, which by nature presents certain 
input size restrictions or limitations in dealing with complex contexts.  
Strategies such as (Fine -tuning, Grounding LLMs, Retrieval -Augmented Generation -RAG, ML, Analytics) were 
not used, which directly contribute to improving the understanding and responsiveness of the model, allowing it to 
connect more effectively with the re al world and generate more relevant and useful answers to the queries  
presented to it.  
Bias in the Definition of Scenarios:  We understand that the definition of scenarios and questions can 
introduce bias into the simulation, affecting the results and conclusions obtained. The way scenarios are structured,  
and questions are formulated can influence the answers generated by language models and, consequently, the 
insights obtained.  
Validation of Results:  Validating the results obtained in the simulation can be challenging, since they are 
generated by language models and may not necessarily reflect reality. We use a simplified methodology focusing on 
devices used in qualitative analysis.  
Although there are limitations and challenges to be overcome, the integration of multi -agent systems (SMA) 
and large language models (LLM) represents a unique opportunity to transform human -machine interaction in 
modern organizations. By proactively recogn izing and addressing these limitations, organizations can fully leverage 
the potential of these innovative approaches to improve the efficiency, accuracy, and adaptability of their 
operations.  
5 Ethical Considerations  
 
It is important to recognize that the use of AI brings with it ethical and regulatory issues, especially related to 
data protection and transparency in decision -making processes. As organizations explore the possibilities of this 
technology, it is critical  to maintain a balance between the pursuit of innovation and protecting the interests of 
everyone involved (not exhaustive).  
▪ Privacy and Data Protection:  The proposed framework aims to enable human participation in 
conversations and processes that may involve human activity combined with AI.  
▪ Bias and Fairness:  In the case of using LLMs, it is known that they can exhibit biases, caused by the 
nature of the technology or the use of training data, which is important in any solutions of this nature 
to mitigate prejudices, deviations, and other forms of imbalance.  
▪ Responsibility and Transparency:  The structure may involve multiple agents talking and cooperating, 
it is important to establish clear responsibility and transparency mechanisms. The platform under 
development will understand, track,  and govern decision making from data selection to the design of 
agents and metahumans.  
 
6 Conclusions  and Reflexions  
 
This study explored the revolutionary potential of multi -agent systems (SMA) combined with large language 
models (LLM) in transforming competition into collaboration considering aspects for modern organizations, we used 
only a short simulation of a simplif ied debate between two professionals with different experiences and knowledge,  
but with convergent objectives, using simplified code, elementary components,  and prompt engineering.  
We understand that the greatest contribution is the demonstration that by employing specialized multi -
agents, developed from LLMs, demonstrates the ability to create diverse solutions and useful meta -humans in 
different areas of knowledge such as:  
▪ Information Retrieval:  LLM can quickly gather information from various sources and provide relevant 
data to support decision -making processes within organizations.  
▪ Task Automation:  LLM can automate repetitive tasks, such as scheduling meetings, answering 
common queries, or generating reports, freeing up human resources to focus on more complex and 
strategic tasks.  
▪ Customer Support:  LLM can assist in customer support by answering frequently asked questions, 
troubleshooting issues, and providing personalized recommendations based on customer inquiries.  
▪ Training and Education:  LLM can facilitate training and education by providing interactive learning 
experiences, debates,  point of views,  answering questions, and offering explanations on complex 
topics.  17  ▪ Collaborative Problem -Solving:  LLM can collaborate with humans and other agents to solve complex 
problems by providing insights, suggestions, and alternative perspectives.  
▪ Language Translation and Interpretation:  LLM can assist in language translation and interpretation 
tasks, helping to bridge communication gaps between individuals and organizations from different 
linguistic backgrounds.  
▪ Content Creation and Curation:  LLM can generate content for marketing materials, social media 
posts, and other communication channels, as well as curate relevant content from the web.  
▪ Decision Support:  LLM can analyze data, generate insights, and provide recommendations to support 
decision -making processes within organizations.  
This study represents an initial step in exploring the potential to transform the way organizations use 
collaborative tools  and resources , especially by combining concepts, theories, principles,  and practices related 
to Multi -Agent Systems (SMA), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Large Models of Language (LLM), Artificial , Archetypes, 
Personas, meta -humans, design, suggested human behavior and questions intrinsic to each topic that are great
