Abstract
This paper seeks to study the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic based on daily published
data from Worldometer website, using a time-dependent SIR model. Our findings indicate that
this model fits well such data, for different chosen periods and different regions.
This well-known model, consisting of three disjoint compartments, susceptible , infected , and
removed , depends in our case on two time dependent parameters, the infection rate β(t) and the
removal rate ρ(t). After deriving the model, we prove the local exponential behavior of the number
of infected people, be it growth or decay. Furthermore, we extract a time dependent replacement
factor σs(t) =β(t)s(t)/ρ(t), where s(t) is the ratio of susceptible people at time t. In addition,
i(t) and r(t) are respectively the ratios of infected and removed people, based on a population of
sizeN, usually assumed to be constant.
Besides these theoretical results, the report provides simulations on the daily data obtained for
Germany, Italy, and the entire World, as collected from Worldometer over the period stretching
from April 2020 to June 2022. The computational model consists of the estimation of β(t),ρ(t)
ands(t) based on the time-dependent SIR model. The validation of our approach is demonstrated
by comparing the profiles of the collected i(t), r(t) data and those obtained from the SIR model
with the approximated parameters.
We also consider matching the data with a constant-coefficient SIR model, which seems to be
working only for short periods. Thus, such model helps understanding and predicting the evolution
of the pandemics for short periods of time where no radical change occurs.

1 Introduction
Since 2019 and during its early stages, COVID-19 became a worldwide concern, as it was spreading fast
and leading to death in certain cases [7]. Not enough data was presented to comprehend its mechanisms
and means of transmission [11]. The degree of severity of the symptoms of this virus often ranged from
none to extremes. Many people who were asymptomatic were spreading the virus because they were
unaware they had it in the first place [8], [3]. These unreported cases made it difficult to track the
severity of the virus and study it smoothly. A study in Brazil showed that neglecting unreported cases
has had “contradictory effects in maintaining the disease” [1]. With the progression of the virus, more
data was collected and different mathematical and statistical models along with AI were employed in
attempting to address several scientific and healthcare imminent questions. Thousands of papers were
written on this topic, some of these were compiled in the 2021 paper [12] and the 2022 paper [9].
These models attempt at studying on a global or local scale, different parameters, related to the
pandemics, such as mortality, etc. Regardless of their objectives, those models used different types

combined to artificial intelligence. Other approaches were simply of compartmental nature.
Since COVID is very similar in characteristics to SARS, the model frequently worked with is the
constant coefficient SIR model, originally developed by Kermack and McKendrick [4]. This model
helps in finding, or estimating, through numerical simulations, various important parameters such as,
the maximum number of infected people [13], the number of people that need to be vaccinated [10],
the expected duration of a pandemic. It also helps study the reproduction factor, a key parameter
revealed by the constant coefficients SIR model, which sheds light on the progression, sustainability,
and decay of the pandemic. Thus, on the basis of theoretical results, added to numerical simulations
run on available large amounts of data, one has powerful tools that provide better understanding of
the phenomena and issues at hand [13].
However, sample of the surveyed results indicate that the constant coefficient SIR model is not well-
fitted for analyzing the effects of vaccination, immunity, lock downs and social distancing in reducing
the transmission and contact rates and in explaining the rapid rise or rapid decay in the number
of infected people within a population, especially in what may be considered as the late-phase(s) of
COVID-19 ([11], [3]). Therefore, implementing protection and actions in anticipation of any future
new outbreak of the pandemics, requires more complex models to forecast values in the long run. Some
variants of the constant coefficients SIR model could provide more accurate estimations of parameter
values [7], [5], [6], [2]. However, the data needed to be able to use such variants is normally not
available.
In this work, our starting point is the data we have daily collected daily between April 2020 and
June 2022, from the Worldometer Corona Virus Platform . The main reported records on each
dayt, are as follows:
1.I(t), the number of infected people,
2.CN(t), the number of newly infected persons,
3.CI(t), the cumulative number of infected cases,
4.CD(t), the cumulative number of deceased, out of the infected population,
5.CR(t), the cumulative number of recovered, out of the infected population,
Based on these real time data, we attempt to develop models that would at least reproduce the data
being reported, particularly in terms of the number of infected cases I(t). Using the basic balance
equation, that governs the dynamics of a pandemics, namely:
I′(t) =FI(t)−FR(t)
we derive successively a time-dependent IR (1) followed by (10), a time-dependent SIR models. Such
perception of the pandemics naturally excludes a constant coefficients SIR model, as was mentioned
in the works cited above. Such models depend on time-dependent coefficients measuring the impact
of infective and removal (death and recovery) forces. At that point of our research, independently of
other types of data such as those people declared medically immune or reported as vaccinated or being
in contact with others, the models derived allow to:
1. reproduce the collected data, with at least 90 % accuracy.
2. monitor the pandemics on short periods of time, revealing either outbreak or decay.
3. provide in case of outbreak, the level of confinement that should be adopted by health authorities.
The remaining part of this paper is divided as follows.
In Section 2, we derive the models and then prove the exponential growth and decay of the pan-
demics, particularly Theorems 3 and 4.
In Section 3, we perform simulations on real data for Germany, Italy, and the world, as collected
from Worldometer over a span of two years. First, the appropriate compartments’ data is extracted
and used to approximate the time-dependent parameters of the model. Then, the time dependent
SIR model is discretized using Runge-Kutta schemes to regenerate the worldometer data and test the
accuracy of this model. Moreover, we graph and discuss the evolution of the pandemic’s compartments
2and parameters during the outbreaks, on some random interval and on the entire period. The models
did not reveal any pattern as to how the pandemics would generally outbreak, in spite of people being
vaccinated, and/or confined.
Alternatively, we explore in section 4, the possibility of developing a short-term constant-coefficient
model to predict the pandemics evolution.
Finally, we conclude in section 5 and suggest tracks for future research.
2 The Time-Dependent IR and SIR Models
Both IR and SIR models are compartmental models based on categorizing the population into respec-
tively two and three groups or compartments.
2.1 Derivation of the Time-Dependent IR Model
In the IR model one has only the infected and removed categories, this last category including those
people who were originally infected, and have either died or recovered. There are some basic hypotheses
one considers when using a compartmental model. In the case of an IR model, one assumes that over
the period under study:
1. An infected person is automatically active and remains in the infected category until removal
through recovery or death.
2. Once a person is in the removed compartment, he/she cannot go backward to the infected
compartment (A recovered person has permanent immunity over the period under scrutiny).
3. Population birth and death rates are not taken into consideration.
The derivation of the IR model comes from the original idea in Kermack-McKendrick Model which
considers the pandemics as the resultant of two forces: the infective FI(t) and the removal forces FR(t).
(
I′(t) =FI(t)−FR(t)
R′(t) =FR(t)(1)
At this point, one must make additional assumptions, the simplest being the linear dependence of
FR(t) and FI(t) onI(t), specifically:
•FR(t) =ρ(t)I(t), with:
–ρ(t) =µ(t) +γ(t) is the total removal rate per individual at time t.
–µ(t) being the death rate at time tper infected individual, and
–γ(t) the recovery rate at time tper infected individual.
•As for FI(t) we make the following assumption. It is also proportional to I(t), with a propor-
tionality factor βs(t), where:
FI(t) =βs(t)I(t) (2)
Thus in this case, (1) reduces to a linear initial value ordinary differential equation:
(
I′(t) = (βs(t)−ρ(t))I(t),
R′(t) =ρ(t)I(t).(3)
that can be solved as a decoupled system on any interval [ t0, T], provided that I(t0) and R(t0) are
given, and βs(t) and ρ(t) approximated using (18) and (19).
Solving first for I(t) on the interval [ ti, ti+1] and then for R(t), one gets :
I(ti+1) = I(ti)eRti+1
ti(βs(t)−ρ(t))dt, (4)
R(ti+1) = R(ti) +Zti+1
tiρ(t)I(t)dt (5)
3which numerically can be solved using any approximation formula for the integralsRti+1
ti(βs(t)−ρ(t))dt
andRti+1
tiρ(t)I(t)dt.
Note from (4) the exponential behavior of I(t), be it growth or decay, depending if the ratioβs
ρis
greater than or less than 1 respectively. As for R(t), it is always increasing given the positivity of
ρ(t)I(t).
Naturally, this IR model is a flat two-compartments model. It does not consider, the stage(s) before
infection, and after recovery. For example, after recovery, a person may become immune or may get
infected another time, i.e. be part of the infective forces.
Moving forward in modeling the pandemics, one must look into the pre-infection stages, considering
the main factors for its spreading are the following:
1. Power of the virus to be transmitted, βv(t)
2. Immunity of the non-infected people (vaccine, individual immunity), βm(t)
3. The probability to get infected (mask-wearing, getting in contact with an infected individual,...),
p(t)
where assuming these factors are multiplicative, i.e. βs(t) =βv(t)βm(t)p(t), then (2) becomes
FI(t) =βv(t)βm(t)p(t)I(t). (6)
As we are considering Data-Driven modeling, at this stage we do not have any available data that
could measure βv(t) and βm(t) independently.
On the other hand, one could attempt to categorize the non-infected and non-removed in subcate-
gories, such as
•the category of people with a high-level of immunity (strongly positive antibody test), that will
protect them from the virus.
•the category of people who were tested negative but yet were infected.
•the category of isolated people.
However, since we do not have enough data on these subcategories, we lump them all in one “suscep-
tible” compartment, leading to an SIR model.
2.2 Derivation of the Time-Dependent SIR Model
At this point, the additional assumptions to move ahead from the IR model is that all people who are
not infected or removed, have equal chance p(t) =S(t)
N(t)of becoming infected. Thus, these belong to
a third susceptible compartment, S(t), such that
S(t) +I(t) +R(t) =N(t) (7)
where N(t) is the total size of the population. Since in the literatureS(t)
N(t)is denoted by s(t), thus we
will denote p(t) bys(t). Therefore, (6) becomes
FI(t) =β(t)s(t)I(t), (8)
where β(t) =βv(t)∗βm(t).
We derive (7) with respect to tand use (3), to get
S′(t) =N′(t)−R′(t)−I′(t) =N′(t)−FI(t) (9)
4To get the well-known Kermack–McKendrick SIR model, we assume a closed population, i.e. N(t) =
Nis fixed. Accordingly, N′(t) = 0 and we get system (10)


S′(t) =−β(t)·S(t)
N·I(t)
I′(t) =β(t)·S(t)
N·I(t)−ρ(t)·I(t)
R′(t) =ρ(t)·I(t)
S(t0) =S0;I(t0) =I0;R(t0) =R0(10)
Normalizing the equations, i.e. dividing by the assumed constant size Nof the population on both
sides of each equation, one gets:


s′(t) =−β(t)·s(t)·i(t)
i′(t) =β(t)·s(t)·i(t)−ρ(t)·i(t)
r′(t) =ρ(t)·i(t)
s(t0) =s0;i(t0) =i0;r(t0) =r0(11)
where
•s(t) =S(t)
N, i(t) =I(t)
N,andr(t) =R(t)
N.
•0≤s(t), i(t), r(t)≤1, and s(t) +i(t) +r(t) = 1
•S(t) is at least 1 for t <∞since there must be at least one susceptible person during a given
period of time.
2.3 Theoretical Study of the SIR Model
In this section, we will be focusing on the theoretical aspects of the model. A theoretical analysis
is significant prior to computational work, as it presents a basis for our work and is means to find
out whether the work is correct or not. We analyze the time-dependent SIR model by listing three
theorems along with their proofs which describe the changes in the three compartments and especially
the exponential growth and decay in the infected compartment.
Theorem 1. s(t)is strictly decreasing if i(t)>0and stagnates if i(t) = 0 . Whereas r(t)is strictly
increasing if i(t)>0and stagnates if i(t) = 0 .
Proof. 1. Since β(t)>0,s(t)>0∀t >0, and i(t)≥0∀t >0, then by (11)-(a)
s′(t) =−β(t)·s(t)·i(t)≤0∀t >0
which implies that s(t) is strictly decreasing when i(t)>0, and stagnates when i(t) = 0.
2. Since ρ(t)>0 and i(t)≥0∀t >0, then by (11)-(c)
r′(t) =ρ(t)·i(t)≥0∀t >0
which implies that R is strictly increasing when i(t)>0, and stagnates when i(t) = 0.
Now, we write equation (11)-(b) as follows:
i′(t) = ( β(t)s(t)−ρ(t))·i(t), (12)
Thus the variation of the ratio of number of infected i(t) depends on the sign of β(t)s(t)−ρ(t).
Hence if:
ρ(t)(s(t)β(t)
ρ(t)−1)(
>0,there is an outbreak of the pandemics
<0,then the pandemic is in an decreasing mode.
We introduce now:
51. The basic reproduction factor at time t:σ(t) :=β(t)
ρ(t), is the maximum number of secondary
infections introduced when one infective is introduced in a totally susceptible population.
2. The replacement number at time t:σs(t) =σ(t)s(t) =βs(t)
ρ(t)which is the number of secondary
infections produced by a typical infective in a population in which the ratio of susceptible pop-
ulation is s(t).
and therefore equation (12) can be rewritten as:
i′(t) = (σs(t)−1)ρ(t)i(t) (13)
Criteria for Growth and Decay of the Pandemics
Then, one can state:
Theorem 2. The evolution of the disease obeys the following facts:
1. If σs(t)<1, then i′(t)<0, and the pandemics is in decreasing mode.
2. If σs(t)>1, then i′(t)>0and there is an outbreak of the pandemics.
3. If σs(t) = 1 , then i′(t) = 0 and the pandemics stagnates.
Proof. This result is simply obtained from (13).
Thus, to monitor the evolution of the pandemics, one can simply follow-up the variation of σs(t).
As a consequence, we have the following result in case the pandemics is dying out.
Corollary 1. Ifσ(t)<1, then σs(t)<1and the pandemics is in decreasing mode.
Proof. Since s(t)≤1 then σs(t) =s(t)σ(t)≤σ(t)<1 and therefore the first case of Theorem 2
applies.
On the other hand if σ(t)>1, the evolution of the pandemics is a function of the susceptible fraction
s(t). Specifically, one has:
Corollary 2. In case σ(t)>1, then:
1. If s(t)>1
σ(t), there is an outbreak of the pandemics.
2. If s(t)<1
σ(t), the pandemics decreases.
3. If s(t) =1
σ(t), the pandemics stagnates.
Proof. This result is in direct relation with the identity σs(t) =s(t)σ(t) followed with the application
of Theorem 2.
We can now make the following remarks.
Remark 1. On the basis of Theorem 2, monitoring the pandemics can be done by following the
replacement number σs(t).
Remark 2. Thus, when σ(t)>1,1
σ(t)=ρ(t)
β(t)provides a level under which the susceptible fraction
of the population should be kept if one is to avoid outbreak of the pandemics.
To increase1
σ(t)=ρ(t)
β(t), one should either reduce the contact function β(t)or increase the removal
function ρ(t).
The following result provides further clarification on the growth of infected I(t) when σ(t)<1.
6Theorem 3. Assume the rate function β(.), µ(.), γ(.)are continuous, with the existence of t0< t1
such that σ(t)<1fort∈[t0, t1]. Let also, ρmin= min
[t0,t1]{ρ(t)}andσmax= max
[t0,t1]{σs(t)}<1. Then,
i(t)≤i(t0)e−κ0(t−t0),∀t∈[t0, t1],
withκ0=ρmin(1−σmax).
Proof. Dividing (13) by i(t) yields:
1
i(t)di
dt(t) =ρ(t)(σs(t)−1)⇐⇒d
dtln(i(t)) =ρ(t)(σs(t)−1). (14)
Integration from t0totgives:
lni(t)
i(t0)
=Zt
t0ρ(t′)(σs(t′)−1)dt′,
i(t) = i(t0) expZt
t0ρ(t′)(σs(t′)−1)dt′
. (15)
Now σs(t′)−1≤σmax−1<0 and therefore:
ρ(t′)(σs(t′)−1)≤ρ(t′)(σmax−1)<0,
which leads to:
ρ(t′)(σs(t′)−1)≤ρ(t′)(σmax−1)≤(σmax−1)ρmin=−κ0<0.
Combining this inequality with (15), yields to the result of theorem.
Turning now to the case when σs(t)≥1, one notes thatdi(t)
dtbecomes non-negative, leading to the
following “exponential blow-up” result.
Theorem 4. Assume β(.), µ(.), γ(.)∈C[t0, t1]withσs(t)≥σ0>1fort∈[t0, t1], with
ρmin= min
[t0,t1]{ρ(t)}, then:
i(t)≥i(t0)eκ1(t−t0),∀t∈[t0, t1],
withκ1=ρmin(σ0−1).
Proof. We proceed as in the previous theorem. Based on (14), one writes:
i(t) =i(t0) expZt
t0ρ(t′)(σs(t′)−1)dt′
≥i(t0) exp ( ρmin(σ0−1)(t−t0)),
which leads to the result of the theorem.
3 Simulations on Real Data
The data we get is from Worldometers [14], a reference website that collects data and statistics on
different issues, related to health, demography, economy, food, environment, and media. COVID 19
data has been regularly collected from Worldometers Corona Virus on a set Tn:={t0, t1, ..., t n}of
days over a global period stretching from April 4, 2020 until June 30, 2022 for Italy, Germany and the
world.
The data, collected over the past two years, provides information on the total tests done in a day,
total deaths and recovered, number of infected people in a day, the critical cases, the population size,
and the total cases in some countries or in the whole world. The data fields being sought are indicated
in Table 1.
7Date Cumulative Cumulative Cumulative Active
ti Cases CI(ti)Deaths CD(ti)Recovered CR(ti)Cases ( I(ti))
t0 ...... ....... ...... ......
... ...... ...... ...... ......
tn ...... ...... ...... ......
Table 1: Source Data Fields
The collected data allows the extraction of time-dependent parameters N(t),I(t) and R(t), leading to
S(t). as detailed in section 3.1. Then, in section 3.2 we approximate the time-dependent rates β(t)
andρ(t), and compute σ(t) and σs(t) which are key indicators of the pandemics’ evolution. To validate
the obtained parameters, we run the SIR model using the approximated β(t) and ρ(t) and compare
the estimated results to the actual ones as discussed in section 3.3.
In section 3.4 we test this approach on real data from Italy, Germany, and the world over several
periods that include two outbreaks, a random period, and the entire period. Moreover, an analysis of
the results and the statistical properties of the parameters is provided.
3.1 Extraction of Compartments
First, in section 3.1 we define the total population as an average. In section 3.1 we extract the number
of infected people I(t) and the number of removed people R(t) from collected data. Then, the number
of susceptible S(t) is deduced in section 3.1. Given S(t), I(t), R(t) and N, we get the normalized
fractions s(t), i(t), and r(t).
Population size N
We will consider the population to be constant and not dynamic. Thus, we take the average of the
given total population N(t) over some given period [ t0, tj], i.e.
N=1
j+ 1jX
i=0N(ti)
For example, the average worldwide total population over the period of two years is N= 7,305,100,000.
Extracting I(t) and R(t)
The collected Woldometer data provides the number of:
1. cumulative infected till a certain day ti,CI(ti)
2. cumulative recovered till a certain day ti,CR(ti)
3. cumulative dead till a certain day ti,CD(ti)
4. active cases on a certain day ti,I(ti)
Thus, the total number of infected people at day ti,I(ti) is extracted from data directly. Then, the
fractions of infected people is i(t) =I(t)/N.
The total number of removed people is the sum of total recovered and total dead, i.e.
R(ti) =CR(ti) +CD(ti).
Thus, R(t) is an increasing function as proven in Theorem 2 and shown in the simulation plots. Then,
the fractions of removed people is r(t) =R(t)/N.
8Deducing S(t)
One cannot directly measure the number of susceptible people. So, to find this value, we use the
assumption from our basic SIR model:
At any instant of time,
S(t) +I(t) +R(t) =N(t)
In our case, N(t) := Nis constant as discussed in section 3.1. Thus, S(t) = N−I(t)−R(t),
s(t) =S(t)/N, where
s(t) = 1−i(t)−r(t). (16)
Once the values s(t), i(t) and r(t) are extracted, we create the vectors Iex,RexandSexof the daily
infected fraction i(t), the total cumulative removed fraction r(t), and susceptible fraction s(t) for the
chosen period of time.
3.2 Extraction of Parameters
Given the extracted s(t), i(t) and r(t) as discussed in section 3.1, we consider two methods for approx-
imating the parameters β(t), and ρ(t). The first relies exclusively on the data as detailed in section
3.2.1. The second uses the SIR model along with the data to approximate β(t), and ρ(t) as detailed
in section 3.2.2.
Finally, σ(t) =β(t)/ρ(t) and σs(t) =s(t)·σ(t) can be estimated.
3.2.1 Estimating the parameters β(t),ρ(t) using the Real Data - Method 1
The infective and removal forces FI(t), FR(t) are proportional to I(t).
Thus, given the raw data provided by woldomneter, we can extract βs(t) and ρ(t) which are independent
of any adopted model as follows:
βs(t) =C′
I(t)
I(t), ρ (t) =R′(t)
I(t)(17)
To compute βs(ti) and ρ(ti), we use the following backward difference approximations:
βs(ti)≈CI(ti)−CI(ti−1)
I(ti)(ti−ti−1), (18)
ρ(ti)≈R(ti)−R(ti−1)
I(ti)(ti−ti−1). (19)
If we use the SIR model, then β(t) =βs(t)
s(t)=C′
I(t)
I(t)s(t).
3.2.2 Approximating the parameters β(t),ρ(t) - Method 2
We approximate β(t) and ρ(t), using the data and SIR model by simple algebra.
Using the following equations in (11):
s′(t) = −β(t)s(t)i(t)
r′(t) = ρ(t)i(t)
we get
β(t) =−s′(t)
s(t)i(t)and ρ (t) =r′(t)
i(t). (20)
Hence, we need the values of s′(t) and r′(t). To find s′(t) and r′(t), we use Finite Differences
(forward, backward, and central differences). It is worth noting that the first derivative (whether
s′(0), i′(0), r′(0)) can only be calculated using forward difference, since there are no values that
precede. Similarly, the last derivative ( s′(k), r′(k), i′(k) where k is the last point/day in the collected
data) can only be obtained using backward difference. For the derivatives in between, we use the most
accurate among the three which is the central difference.
After doing so, we find the parameters β(t) and ρ(t) using (20).
93.3 Validation of Obtained Results
Given the daily Worldometer Data described in Table 1, we have the values of I(tn) and R(tn) for
tn∈[t0, T] with an interval of 1 day, i.e. tn+1−tn= 1. Then, we can extract i(tn), r(tn), s(tn),and
approximate β(tn) and ρ(tn) for the given/chosen data set as described in sections 3.1 and 3.2 . Thus,
we can get the reproduction factor σ(tn) and the replacement number σs(tn) which can be used to
analyse the situation.
But before that, we need to validate the obtained results. We do so by solving the Direct SIR Initial
Value Problem (11) using the obtained β(tn) and ρ(tn) values using Method1 and Method2, along with
s(t0), i(t0), r(t0). We solve IVP (11) over the considered time interval [ t0, T] as discussed in the next
paragraph, to obtain the approximate computed solutions sc(tn), ic(tn), rc(tn) forn≥1 and T=t0+k.
Then, we evaluate the L2andL∞relative error norms as shown in Table 2 where Sex, Iex, Rexare the
vectors containing the extracted values from the Worldometer data, whereas Sc, Ic, Rcare the vectors
of the approximate computed Direct problem solutions sc(tn), ic(tn), rc(tn).

Direct Problem Discretization It is possible to discretize the initial value problem y′(t) =
f(t, y(t)) with y(t0) =y0fort∈[t0, T] using Runge-Kutta schemes. The most known and used
RK-scheme is the 4thorder RK-scheme defined for the time step h=tn+1−tnas:

The function handle f(t, y(t)),y(t),y0, and hhave to be defined. For the SIR problem (11), y(t)
andy0are vectors, and f(t, y(t)) is actually a vectorized function depending also on β(t) and ρ(t)
defined by

.
Given that β(tn) and ρ(tn) are approximated on a daily basis for t0≤tn≤T=tk=t0+kand
n= 0,1,···, k, we set h= 2 days. Note that it is possible to set h= 1 day, but then evaluating
f(tn+h/2, yn+k/2) := f 
tn+h/2, yn+k/2, β(tn+h/2), ρ(tn+h/2)
requires interpolating the data sets β(tn) and ρ(tn) to get the values β(tn+ 0.5) and ρ(tn+ 0.5).
Throughout the paper, we use the fourth order Runge-Kutta scheme for our simulations.
3.4 Testings and Simulations
The data collected extends over two years, mainly from April 2020 till June 2022, and highlights two
strong changes in the number of infected people. The duration of these outbreaks differ between Italy,
Germany, and the world, and are summarized in Table 3.

Table 3: The considered periods for testing
In this section, we use Italy’s, Germany’s, and the world’s data to approximate the parameters
as discussed in section 3.1 for the first outbreak (section 3.4), the second outbreak (section A.1),
random periods (section A.2), and the whole two years period (section A.3) . The obtained parameters
βs(t), ρ(t) using method 1 are then used in the SIR model to obtain the simulated values of s(t), i(t), r(t)
as discussed in section 3.3. We compare the real data to the simulated results to validate the efficiency
of the SIR model in fitting the real-life data and the accuracy of the computed parameters. Note that
we have also tested the IR model where the parameters β(t), ρ(t) are obtained using methods 1 or 2.
However, we do not show the results in this report as they are identical to that of the SIR model.
First Outbreak
Figures 1, 2, and 3 plot the approximated parameters β(t), ρ(t), σ(t), and σs(t) using Method 1 (sec-
tion 3.2.1) and Method 2 (section 3.2.2) during the first outbreak in Italy, Germany, and the world
respectively. Clearly the results of both methods are similar in global behavior, with some different
variations. These differences are detailed in Tables 4, 5 6, and 7 that summarize the statistical prop-
erties (mean, median, standard deviation) of the approximated parameters β(t),ρ(t),σ(t), and σs(t)
respectively. Note that the mean of the 4 parameters is larger than or equal to the median.
Moreover, Table 8 computes the relative L2 and Linfinity errors between the parameters computed
using both methods. These errors are of order 10−1for all parameters and all three countries. As for
the absolute errors of the parameters at some time ti, then by comparing the means, it is clear that it
is of order 10−3forβandρ(except for germany, 10−2), and 10−1forσandσs(except for the world,
10−2).

Table 8: The L2andL∞relative errors between the computed parameters based on Methods 1 and
2, for the first outbreak.
To validate these results, we run the SIR model with the obtained parameters β(t), ρ(t) using
method 1 or method 2, and the corresponding initial values as discussed in section 3.3. Figures 4,
5, and 6 compare the behavior of the ratio of compartments s(t), i(t), r(t) of the real data to the
simulated values. Moreover, Table 9 shows the relative errors between the real data and simulated
values. Clearly, the time-dependent SIR model simulates efficiently the real situation. The trends of
the three compartments in all three simulations are as expected. The number of infected increased
then decreased (somewhat exponential), and naturally, the number of susceptible decreased whereas
that of the removed increased. The number of infected, even at the maximum, is much lower than
that of the susceptible. Thus, even in periods of outbreaks, most of the population is still not infected.
However, it is clear that the simulated results using method 2 are more accurate than those obtained
using method 1, with L2 relative errors are of order 10−3versus 10−2fori(t) and r(t), and 10−5versus
10−3fors(t). This is expected since method 2 uses the SIR model to approximate βandρ, whereas
method 1 relies only on data.
Moreover, note that there are some inconsistencies in the reported worldometer data during the first
outbreak, specifically in the Case of Germany, which shows in the larger relative errors for method
1 (Table 9) and in the difference in the simulated s,i,r in figure 5. When investigating about such
inconsistency, we discovered that during the first outbreak the reported cumulative infected cases
CI(t+ ∆t)−CI(t) is not equal to the reported number of new cases at time t+ ∆t.
12For Italy and the whole world the simulated s,i,r using parameters obtained via method 1 or method
2 have the same shapes and variations with a small margine of error. This validates the time-dependent
SIR model, and the methods used for computing the parameters.

Table 9: The L2andL∞relative errors of the computed S,I,R from the time-dependent model with
the S,I,R collected from data during the first outbreak, where β, ρare computed using Method 1 or 2.
Analyzing the approximated values of the parameters, we observe the following. In Italy the
infection rate has an increasing trend over the first 40 days followed by a decreasing one as seen in
figures 1a and 1b. Whereas, in Germany the infection rate is in a decreasing mode (figures 2a and
2b) and it is somehow stable worldwide (figures 3a and 3b). Yet, the maximum infection rate in this
17first outbreak occurs in the world, on the second day with a value of ≈0.2 as seen in figures 3a and
3b. On the other hand, the mean, median, and standard deviation of the infection rate are highest for
Germany and lowest for the world.
On the other hand, the removal rate for Italy (figures 1c and 1d) and Germany (figures 2c and 2d)
seem to have an increasing trend during the first outbreak, which implies a larger number of people
are getting recovered in a smaller amount of time. As for the world (figures 3c and 3d), the removal
rate fluctuates within a certain range ([0.2, 0.5]) with the exception of a few peaks. The highest peak
occurs around day 370 which corresponds to a sudden drop in the infected (figure 6b).
The reproduction factor and replacement number have the same behavior, which is mainly propor-
tional to that of β(t). Thus, for Italy (figures 1e, 1f, 1g and 1h), both σ(t) and σs(t) increase first to a
maximum value of ≈9.6 (Method 1) or ≈9.3 (Method 2). As for the world (figures 3e, 3f, 3g and 3h),
σ(t) and σs(t) show a decreasing trend from a value of 3 to a value close to 1. Since the replacement
number is on average greater than one, this reaffirms the fact that the period considered is indeed an
outbreak period.
Note that the mean, median, and maximum σs(t) values are the highest for Italy. This means
that there are several countries that did not go through a strong outbreak during that period as Italy,
which was one of the first countries to have a rapid spread of COVID-19.
4 Do Constant Coefficient SIR’s Predict Covid-19 Dynamics?
So far, all the discussions that were performed in the previous section, were merely analysing situations
that already occurred to better understand, assess and improve performance in the future. However,
they do not allow to extrapolate and predict how the pandemic will evolve in the coming days, weeks
or months, since the time-dependent parameters β(t) and ρ(t) cannot be known beforehand. Their
approximations in section 3.2 were based on given data, which are not available in case of prediction.
Unless these parameters can be determined based on some medical assumptions or observations, it is
not possible to use a time-dependent SIR model to predict accurately the evolution of the pandemic.
Thus, we consider a constant-coefficient model where βandρare constants.
Unlike the time-dependent model, a constant-coefficient cannot depict the fluctuations in the com-
partments for large periods, and may also give totally incorrect results as shown in section 4.1. Hence,
we consider a constant-coefficient model for predicting the evolution of the pandemic for a short period
of time in section 4.2.
4.1 Incompatibility of Constant-Coefficient Models for Covid-19
In this section we consider the Constant-Coefficient SIR model, where β, ρ, andσare constants, and
test its efficiency for modeling the Covid-19 Pandemic using the worldometer data for the world. We
consider three different increasing time intervals (Table 10), extract the compartments and parameters
as discussed in sections 3.1 and 3.2.1 (Method 1) respectively. Then, we transform each of the vectors
with the β(t) and ρ(t) values for the chosen period of time into a constant, by taking the average, or
the median.

Moreover, the relative errors of the simulated S,I,R using the constant-coefficient model with the 2
parameters’ calculations are summarized in Table 11 and compared to that of the time-dependent
model.

Table 11: Relative errors between the S,I,R values computed from the constant-coefficient model with
average or median β, ρvalues or time-dependent model; and the S,I,R values collected from the world
data for different periods.
Given that s(t) is decreasing and r(t) is increasing for any time t, then the simulated values
approximate these trends. However, the constant-coefficient model using the average or the median,
doesn’t capture the variations in i(t) for larger time intervals. Thus, the constant-coefficient model
shows its inefficiency and inaccuracy, since the larger the time interval used, the larger the relative
errors as shown in Table 11, where the relative errors are the largest for i(t).
However, it is worth noting that for the 4-days period, the relative errors of the constant-coefficient
with average are of the same order as the time-dependent model. Since the parameters should not
vary much during a small interval of time, taking the average is a good representation of their actual
values and thus does not alter the real data by a huge factor. Moreover, the small magnitude of the
errors suggest the possibility of predicting the the evolution of the pandemic for a few days using the
constant-coefficient model. Note that the same tests were performed with β(t) and ρ(t) computed
using Method 2 (section 3.2.2) instead of Method 1, and the similar results are shown in Appendix B.
4.2 Predicting
Given that the β(t) and ρ(t) are not know beforehand, and unless they can be approximated using some
medical or statistical assumptions, one cannot use the time-dependent model for prediction. More-
over, due to the inefficiency of the constant-coefficient model for simulating accurately the COVID-19
pandemic, which is highly time dependent, then it cannot be used for prediction purposes over large
periods of time. We consider small periods of times, not exceeding one month and check if the constant-
coefficient SIR model can predict the dynamics and evolution of the COVID-19 pandemics.
Many studies consider some fixed value for βandρwhen predicting the evolution of the pandemics.
However, based on the testings in section 3.4 the average of β(t) and ρ(t) vary over different periods
of time and for different countries. Thus, we consider computing the constant βandρbased on the
data.
Given the Worldometer data up till some day ti, and assuming we want to predict the dynamics
of COVID-19 for the next k≤30 days, i.e t= [ti+ 1, ti+k], we compute the values of the parameters
β(t) and ρ(t) for the previous kdays, i.e. t= [ti−k+ 1, ti], using Method 1 (section 3.2.1). Then, we
take the average of the obtained vectors to define the constants βandρ, run the constant-coefficient
SIR model starting with t0=tiwith the obtained constant parameters, and compare the obtained
compartments to the exact data.
22Note that it is possible to approximate the constant parameters βandρin different ways, such
as taking the average β(t) and ρ(t) computed over some fixed interval independent of the duration k.
However, these options are not considered in this paper.
We consider 4 starting dates t0indicated in Table 12 and test the efficiency of the constant coefficient
model for different durations k= 5,10,15,20,25,30. Figures 13, 14, 16, show the predicted s(t) for the
considered starting dates with a duration of 10, 15 and 30 days respectively. Figures 17, 18, 20, show
the predicted i(t) for the considered starting dates with a duration of 10, 15 and 30 days respectively.
Figures 21, 22, 24, show the predicted r(t) for the considered starting dates with a duration of 10, 15
and 30 days respectively. Moreover, Table 13 summarizes the corresponding relative errors between
the predicted compartments and the exact data.

Similarly to previous tests, the relative error for s(t) was the smallest and of order 10−4or 10−5
(depending of the starting date) and slightly increases with the increase of the duration. The relative
error of s(t) also slightly increases with the increase of the duration, starting with an error of order
10−2or 10−3. However, the relative error is more affected by the increase of the prediction duration
k, as it increases from 10−3to 10−2to 10−1(t3).
This difference in sensitivity to the prediction duration can be seen in the figures where for s(t) and
r(t), the prediction curves are a good approximation of the exact data for the majority of cases and
durations (except for t1 and k= 30, figure 16). On the other hand, given that i(t) varies more than
s(t) and i(t), the predicted i(t) may or may not be a good approximation depending on the similarity
of the situation where the parameters are approximated to that of the prediction time. For example,
the starting date of t2 is 20 days after t1, and t4 is 4 days after t3. Yet, the predicted i(t) for duration
k= 10 or 15 (figures 17, 18) is a very good approximation of the exact data for t2 and t4, unlike t1
andt3. For duration k= 30 (figures 20), the predicted i(t) for t2 and t3 better approximated the
exact data than for t1 and t4.

Thus clearly, it is possible to predict the evolution of the pandemics using the constant-coefficient
SIR model for short periods of time up to 20 days. However, it is preferable to use shorter prediction
intervals such as 10 or 15 days, since the increasing or decreasing mode of i(t) is approximated with a
relative error of order 10−2.
Note that the same tests were performed with β(t) and ρ(t) computed using Method 2 (section
3.2.2) instead of Method 1, and the similar results are shown in Appendix B.1.
295 Conclusion
Since the spread of COVID-19, thousands of papers dealing with different aspects of the pandemics and
different types of models, have been published. In this work, our starting point is the Worldometer
Corona Virus Platform data, daily collected between April 2020 and June 2022. Based on this data,
and the basic balance equation that governs the dynamics of a pandemics, we derived a time-dependent
IR model (1) followed by a time-dependent SIR model (10). For both models, we have proven local
exponential growth (or decay) of the number of infections I(t). We also introduce a time-dependent
reproduction parameter σs(t), that can monitor the outbreak of the pandemics ( σs(t)>1) or its
stabilisation and decay ( σs(t)≤1). The collected data allows to extract the time-dependent rates
βs(t),β(t) and ρ(t) in 2 different ways, in view of computing σs(t) and σ(t), the key indicators of the
pandemics’ evolution. The accuracy of our approach is validated by the resulting matching between
the simulated i(t) and r(t) values with the collected ones. This shows that the time-dependent SIR
model is efficient in describing the pandemics’ behavior.
The time-dependent SIR model was then applied over different periods of time for Germany, Italy
and the whole world by computing βs(t),β(t),ρ(t),σ(t) and σs(t). These parameters fluctuated with
respect to time and their statistics varied across countries. This variation may be probably due to
important factors such as vaccination, confinement, social interaction, immunity,... that depend on
the implemented policies in every geographical region. Thus, there do not seem to be a way to predict
beforehand the evolution of βs(t),β(t) and ρ(t).
On the other hand, the use of a constant-coefficient SIR model to simulate the evolution of COVID-
19, seems also to be inefficient, given the fluctuations in β(t) and ρ(t). Yet, it is possible to use it
for short-term predictions by setting the constant βandρas the average of β(t) and ρ(t) which are
computed based on available data.
As for future work, provided additional data is made available to detail the pre-infection stages,
then one could consider different variants of the SIR model, for example, the SVIR model which adds
a new compartment for vaccinated people, with the aim of analyzing the effect of vaccination on the
population in maintaining and controlling the pandemic. Other variants could also be considered,
where the susceptible compartment is divided further into smaller sub-compartments that distinguish
between isolated, moderately susceptible, and highly susceptible individuals.

A Simulations for Time-dependent SIR Model
A.1 Second Outbreak
For the second outbreak, Figures 25, 26, and 27 plot the approximated parameters β(t), ρ(t), σ(t), and
σs(t) using Method 1 (section 3.2.1) and Method 2 (section 3.2.2) in Italy, Germany, and the world
respectively. Similarly to the first outbreak, the results of both methods are comparable in global
behavior, with some minor variations. Tables 14, 15 16, and 17 summarize the statistical properties
of the approximated parameters β(t),ρ(t),σ(t), and σs(t) respectively.
Moreover, Table 18 computes the relative L2 and Linfinity errors between the parameters computed
using both methods. These errors are again of order 10−1for all parameters and all three countries.
As for the absolute errors of the parameters at some time ti, then by comparing the means, it is clear
that it is of order 10−3forβandρ, 10−3forσ(except for Italy, 10−2), and 10−2forσs(except for
Italy, 10−1).

Again, we validate these results, by running the SIR model with the obtained parameters β(t), ρ(t)
using method 1 or method 2, and the corresponding initial values as discussed in section 3.3. Figures
28, 29, and 30 compare the behavior of the ratio of compartments s(t), i(t), r(t) of the real data to the
simulated values. Moreover, Table 19 shows the relative errors between the real data and simulated
values. The trends of the three compartments in all three simulations are as expected and similar to
the first outbreak: the number of infected people increases then decreases, the number of susceptible
people decreases, and the number of removed people increases. Moreover, we also see a slight difference
in the simulated results using methods 1 and 2, where the second is more accurate with an L2 relative
error 10 times less than the first method (Table 19). Note that for this period the simulated data using
method 1 for Germany is comparable to that of Italy, since there is no data inconsistencies, unlike in
the first outbreak.

By comparing the table of relative errors for the second outbreak (table 19) to that for the first
outbreak (table 9), one can note that the errors using method 2 in the second outbreak are of the same
order with some values slightly higher (example s and r errors for Italy ).

Table 19: L2andL∞relative errors of the computed S,I,R from the time-dependent model with the
S,I,R collected from data during the second outbreak, where β, ρare computed using Method 1 or 2.
We observe the following for the parameters ( β,ρ,σ,σs). The infection rate in Italy and Germany
has a similar behavior to the first outbreak (figures 25a, 25b, 26a, and 26b ). On the other hand, the
mean and the median of the infection rate for Italy are higher than those for Germany, which could be
an indicator that the second outbreak in Italy was stronger and more spread out, as more people are
37getting infected and less people were getting removed (i.e. the infection period lasted longer). This is
validated by the fact that σandσsare larger for Italy than Germany.
Moreover, by comparing the parameters obtained in the second outbreak to that of the first out-
break, it is clear that the second outbreak in Italy was not as strong as the first, not because it was
less spread (i.e. smaller β). On the contrary, more people were infected, but also more people were
removed (recovered or died) at a faster rate than the first outbreak. Thus, σandσsare smaller than
the first outbreak. However, in Germany the situation is reversed. In the second outbreak βandρ
decreased, but at different rates, leading to a larger σandσs.
As for the world, some fluctuations are observed (figures 27a and 27b), where the maximum infection
rate attained at some time between the 192ndday and the 250thhas a value of 0.1 (method 1) or 0.0872
(method 2), that is smaller than that attained during the first outbreak. Similarly, the mean, median
and standard deviation are relatively smaller than those of the first outbreak since the range of βvalues
is tighter ([0,0.1]) than that of the first outbreak ([0,0.2]). Whereas the removal rate ρis comparable
to that of the first outbreak, thus the mean of σandσsin the second outbreak are slightly less than
those of the first outbreak.
Moreover, The world’s replacement number is naturally smaller than both the one in Italy and
Germany as many countries did not provide accurate or adequate data, or some countries were more
closed off during the pandemic, causing the global replacement number to fall down.
A.2 Other Periods
Figures 31, 32, and 33 plot the approximated parameters β(t), ρ(t), σ(t), and σs(t) using Method 1
(section 3.2.1) and Method 2 (section 3.2.2) during the first outbreak in Italy, Germany, and the world
respectively. Clearly the results of both methods are similar in global behavior, with some different
variations. These differences are detailed in Tables 20, 21 22, and 23 that summarize the statistical
properties (mean, median, standard deviation) of the approximated parameters β(t),ρ(t),σ(t), and
σs(t) respectively.
Moreover, Table 24 computes the relative L2 and Linfinity errors between the parameters computed
using both methods. These errors are of order 10−1for all parameters and all three countries. As for
the absolute errors of the parameters at some time ti, then by comparing the means, it is clear that it
is of orders 10−4, 10−2, and 10−3forβin Italy, Germany, and the world respectively. Whereas, it is
of the order 10−3forρ, and 10−1forσandσs(except for the world, 10−2).

Similarly to the first and second outbreaks, we validate the results by running the SIR model with
the obtained parameters β(t), ρ(t) using method 1 or method 2, and the corresponding initial values
as discussed in section 3.3. Figures 34, 35, and 36 compare the behavior of the ratio of compartments
s(t), i(t), r(t) of the real data to the simulated values. Moreover, Table 25 shows the relative errors
between the real data and simulated values. The number of infected people in both Germany and
the world is only increasing in the respective random periods taken, whereas the number of infected
people increases then decreases during the random period taken in Italy. Naturally, the number of
susceptible people decreases during the random period, showing a somewhat exponential decay in
Italy and linear decays in Germany and the world. The number of removed people increases during
the random period, similar to its behavior in the first and second outbreaks for the three countries.
It is clear from the figures and table of relative errors that there is a slight difference in the simulated
results using methods 1 and 2, where the second is more accurate with an L2 relative error 10 times
less than the first method (Table 25).

Figures 37, 38, and 39 plot the approximated parameters β(t), ρ(t), σ(t), and σs(t) using Method 1
(section 3.2.1) and Method 2 (section 3.2.2) during the first outbreak in Italy, Germany, and the world
44respectively. Clearly the results of both methods are similar in global behavior, with some different
variations. These differences are detailed in Tables 26, 27 28, and 29 that summarize the statistical
properties (mean, median, standard deviation) of the approximated parameters β(t),ρ(t),σ(t), and
σs(t) respectively.
Moreover, Table 30 computes the relative L2 and Linfinity errors between the parameters computed
using both methods. These errors are of order 10−1for all parameters and all three countries, except
for Linfinity for σandσsin Italy where it is 1.341 and 1.254 respectively. As for the absolute errors
of the parameters at some time ti, then by comparing the means, it is clear that it is of orders 10−3
forβ(except for the world, 10−4); whereas, it is of the order 10−2forρ(except for the world, 10−3).
Also, it is of the order 10−2forσ(except for germany, 10−1) and 10−2forσs(except for italy, 10−1).

Table 30: The L2andL∞relative errors between the computed parameters based on Methods 1 and

Just like what has been done in the previous three cases, we validate the results by running the SIR
model with the obtained parameters β(t), ρ(t) using method 1 or method 2, and the corresponding
initial values as discussed in section 3.3. Figures 40 and 41 compare the behavior of the ratio of
compartments s(t), i(t), r(t) of the real data to the simulated values. We do not show the figures of
the compartments for Germany as there is some data inconsistency.
Table 31 shows the relative errors between the real data and simulated values.
A representation of the whole period shows us how both the compartments and the parameters
behave throughout these two years in Italy, Germany, and the world. Simulating all the data together
helps us visualize more clearly how faster the second outbreak is in comparison to the first in all of the
three compartments. Yet it is not stronger than the first, as the σandσsare not larger. The growths
and decays of the infected people in Italy and the world are not perfectly exponential (40b and 41b);
this may be because of the unreported cases, differences in contact rates between people, differences
in immunities, and many other assumptions not considered in the model.
Note that there are several time intervals where I(t) fluctuates rather than increases/decreases sharply.
It is clear from the figures and table of relative errors that there is a slight difference in the simulated
results using methods 1 and 2 where method 2 gives more accurate results as expected.
