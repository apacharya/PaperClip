Causal identiﬁcation in causal Bayes nets (CBNs) is an importa nt tool in causal infer-
ence allowing the derivation of interventional distributi ons from observational distributions
where this is possible in principle. However, most existing formulations of causal iden-
tiﬁcation using techniques such as d-separation and do-cal culus are expressed within the
mathematical language of classical probability theory on C BNs. However, there are many
causal settings where probability theory and hence current causal identiﬁcation techniques
are inapplicable such as relational databases, dataﬂow pro grams such as hardware descrip-
tion languages, distributed systems and most modern machin e learning algorithms. We
show that this restriction can be lifted by replacing the use of classical probability theory
with the alternative axiomatic foundation of symmetric mon oidal categories. In this alter-
native axiomatization, we show how an unambiguous and clean distinction can be drawn
between the general syntax of causal models and any speciﬁc semantic implementation of
that causal model. This allows a purely syntactic algorithmic description of general causal
identiﬁcation by a translation of recent formulations of th e general ID algorithm through
ﬁxing. Our description is given entirely in terms of the non-param etric ADMG structure
specifying a causal model and the algebraic signature of the corresponding monoidal cat-
egory, to which a sequence of manipulations is then applied s o as to arrive at a modiﬁed
monoidal category in which the desired, purely syntactic in terventional causal model, is
obtained. We use this idea to derive purely syntactic analog ues of classical back-door and
front-door causal adjustment, and illustrate an applicati on to a more complex causal model.
1 Introduction
Causal Bayes nets (CBNs) are probabilistic models in which causal inﬂuences between random vari-
ables are expressed via the use of graphs withnodes in these graphs being the random variables and
directed edges indicating the direction of causality between them [ Pearl,2009,Bareinboim et al. ,2020].
Every such directed acyclic graph (DAG) with latent (unobserved ) nodes has a corresponding acyclic
directed mixed graph (ADMG) which is obtained from the DAG through latent projection which sim-
pliﬁes the DAG whilst preserving its causal d-separation properties [ Richardson et al. ,2012,Pearl,
2009].
The ADMGG=/parenleftbig
VG,EG/parenrightbig
with variables VGand edges EGhas bidirected edges indicating unmea-
sured confounding [Richardson et al. ,2012]. Excluding the bidirected edges, the topological propert ies
of these graphs are given by their set-valued parentpaGandchild functions chG.Ancestors anGand
descendents deGare determined recursively from these. The subgraphGYforY⊂VGis obtained by
deleting from VGall nodes not in Yand edges which connect to those removed variables. A sequen ce
of the subset of the nodes in VGsuch that every node in that sequence occurs before its child ren
1(or after its parents) in Gthrough unidirectional edges, is called a topological ordering of the ADMG
[Bareinboim et al. ,2020]. For such an ordering the function preG(V)gives the set of all the nodes
beforeVin the sequence, and succG(V)gives all the nodes after it in the sequence. In the ADMG,
sets of variables which are connected through a sequence of b idirected edges are called districts disG
[Richardson et al. ,2012]. Nodes V∈VGwhich have the property that disG(V)∩deG(V) ={V}are
called ﬁxable nodes [ Richardson et al. ,2012].
For an ADMG with no bidirected edges (thus, no latent variabl es, equivalent to a CBN over a
DAG), it is always possible to derive any interventional dis tribution from the joint distribution over
the variables in the DAG using the truncated factorization [Pearl,2009]. However, more generally, in
the presence of unobserved confounding (e.g. models having bidirected edges in the ADMG) this is
no longer true and only certain interventional distributio ns can be derived from the observed variables
[Shpitser ,2008,Bareinboim et al. ,2020]. Pearl’s do-calculus [Pearl,2009] is a set of three algebraic
distribution transformations which it has been shown are ne cessary and suﬃcient for deriving the in-
terventional distribution where this is possible [ Shpitser ,2008]. These algebraic transformations can
be applied ad-hoc or, more systematically, using Shpitser’ sID algorithm to derive a desired interven-
tional distribution [ Shpitser ,2008]. More recently, the speciﬁc conditions under which any par ticular
interventional distribution can be determined from the obs erved variables using do-calculus or some
other systematic algorithm, has been simpliﬁed in terms of ﬁxing operations andreachable subgraphs
in causal ADMGs [ Richardson et al. ,2012]. Exploiting the same reasoning, Richardson et al. [2012]
show how ﬁxing operations can be combined in a simple algorit hm which achieves the same result.
This algorithm, as with most algorithms for causal inferenc e, is expressed in terms of CBNs using
random variables and classical probabilities where probab ilistic conditioning indicates the direction of
causal inference in an ADMG. Such causal identiﬁcation algo rithms rely on simultaneous manipulation
of the ADMG, tracking the consequence of such manipulations on the corresponding (joint) distribution
over that graph. As long as the appropriate Markov property holds [ Bareinboim et al. ,2020], which
guarantees the consistency of the distribution with the CBN, then this is a valid procedure for deriving
the desired interventional distribution. Nonetheless, th ere are many practical settings where proba-
bilistic modelling is inappropriate, such as relational da tabases [ Patterson ,2017], hardware description
languages, distributed systems modelled by Petri nets and m ost modern machine learning algorithms
[Little,2019]. In these settings there is no such Markov property therefo re it appears that the existing
causal identiﬁcation algorithms are inapplicable in these wider, non-probabilistic applications.
A diﬀerent and more recently explored direction which might circumvent this limitation is to change
the fundamental axiomatic basis of the modelling language t o use ( monoidal )category theory instead.
This amounts to a fundamental reformulation of CBNs that, rat her than organizing causal models
around sets, measure theory and graph topology which requir es the additional complexity of Markov
properties to bind these together, instead views CBNs from th e simpler and more abstract vantage
point of structured compositional processes . Causal modelling and inference in terms of string dia-
grams representing such processes has shown considerable promis e. Building on work by Fong[2013],
Cho and Jacobs [2019] formulated the essential concepts of Bayesian reasoning as strings, following
which Jacobs et al. [2021] provided an exposition of causal identiﬁcation under a sli ghtly extended form
of the front-door causal scenario for aﬃne Markov categories [Fritz,2020]. Since then, string analogues
of do-calculus and d-separation have been described [ Yin and Zhang ,2022,Fritz and Klingler ,2023]
and explicit description of extensions of the categorical s tring diagram approach to causal modelling
in non-probabilistic settings such as machine learning [ Cakiqi and Little ,2022].
Nonetheless the full promise of this reformulation has yet t o be realized. For instance, causal
inference in string diagrams has, to date, only been describ ed in probabilistic categories for single
variable interventions in discrete sample spaces where int erventions can be modelled by discrete uniform
distributions [ Jacobs et al. ,2021], or more generally to string diagrams where causal identiﬁ cation
beyond the slightly extended form of the front-door causal s cenario is not carried out systematically
(algorithmically) but instead requires manual string mani pulation [ Lorenz and Tull ,2023]. Thus, our
goal in this report is to provide the ﬁrst, purely syntactic, algorithmic characterization of general causal

2 Theory
2.1 Symmetric monoidal categories and their algebraic sign atures
Symmetric monoidal categories (SMCs) are algebraic structures which capture the notion of simulta-
neous sequential and (in our application) parallel composition of maps between types. Examples of
such categories include ordinary sets and functions betwee n these sets with the cartesian product indi-
cating parallel composition, the category of sets and relat ions [Fong,2013], (aﬃne)Markov categories
of sample spaces with conditional distributions modelled b y sets and probability monads between them
[Fritz,2020] or other non-deterministic monads in arbitrary semiﬁelds [Cakiqi and Little ,2022].
Following Sellinger [2011], a symmetric monoidal category signature Σprovides all the information
required to specify a particular SMC. This consists of a set o fobject terms Σ0andmorphism variables ,
Σ1, along with a pair of functions dom,cod : Σ 1→Mon(Σ 0)which determine the domain and
codomain of the morphism variables respectively. Here, Mon(Σ 0) = (Σ 0,⊗,1)is the free commutative
monoid generated by the object terms in Σ0.For brevity we will use exponential notation to indicate
terms in Mon(Σ 0)with repeated objects, i.e. for A,B∈Σ0the object expression (A⊗B)⊗(1⊗A)
is written A2B. A morphism with no input, v: 1→A, has monoidal unit domain 1; a morphism
with deleted (empty) output has type u:A→1. We include the domain and codomain functions as
a part of the signature i.e. Σ = (Σ 0,Σ1,dom,cod). To save space, we will alternatively denote the
information in dom,codthrough the more traditional type speciﬁcations of the morp hisms, e.g. for
the category containing the morphism dom(u) =A,dom(v) =AB,cod(u) = 1 andcod(v) =Vwe
writeΣ = ({A,B},{u,v},{u:A→1,v:AB→V}).
An (aﬃne, symmetric) monoidal signature Σdetermines a symmetric monoidal category whose
morphisms are generated by combining morphism variables using sequential composit ion·and com-
mutative monoidal product ⊗along with identities idA:A→A, copies∆A:A→A2and deletions
delA:A→1for every object in A∈Σ0. Every expression formed this way is itself a morphism in the
category speciﬁed by Σ.
However, the signature also determines a speciﬁc causal model which is the one of practical interest,
in the following sense. Construct an expression in which all causal module morphism variable terms
3appear once, composed using sequential composition ◦and monoidal product ⊗, inserting only the
necessary identities and copies in order to ensure that the d omains and codomains of these morphisms
are matched. We call this expression the maximal model (quotiented by the identities, copies and
deletions) determined by the signature. The maximal model i s a (possibly composite) causal morphism
in the monoidal category, with its own domain and codomain. F or example, the signature
Σ =/parenleftbig
{X1,X2,X3},{x1,x2,x3},/braceleftbig
x1: 1→X2
1,x2:X1→X2,x3:X1X2→X3/bracerightbig/parenrightbig
, (1)
has the maximal causal model expression q=x3·(x2⊗idX1)·x1with type
dom(q) = 1x1→X1X1x2⊗idX1−→X2X1x3→X3= cod(q). (2)
While the expression qis itself a morphism in the category generated by Σ, below we will ﬁnd
it useful to isolate this as a separate causal morphism which generates a category with composite
signature Σ′= ({X3},{q},{q: 1→X3}). This signature hides the internal details of how qwas
obtained; the detailed signature can always be reconstruct ed from information in the expression from
which it is formed. We call the signature Σ′= Ext(Σ) theexterior signature Σ, and in this case
Module( X3) =qbecause in Ext(Σ) ,cod(q) =X3.
A convenient graphical notational device for representing such (maximal) causal models are string di-
agrams [Sellinger ,2011] which have a rigorous algebraic meaning which coincides wi th that of monoidal
categories, see Figure 1.
In the next section we build a bridge between latent CBNs repre sented as ADMGs, and their repre-
sentation as (aﬃne) SMC signatures specifying a causal mode l.
2.2 Monoidal category signatures from ADMGs

and for each node (signature object) V∈VGwith corre-
sponding causal module (signature morphism),
dom(Module( V)) =/circlemultiplydisplay
V′∈paG(V)V′
cod(Module( V)) =V|chG(V)|+1.(3)
Our formulation of syntactic causal identiﬁcation can only be applied where the domain and codomain
of the causal module v= Module( V)is explicit in a signature. Therefore, in practice, syntact ic causal
identiﬁcation requires the undirectional part of the ADMG t o be available in chain-factored form. This
is obtained using any topological ordering of the ADMG as ΣF=/parenleftbig
ΣG
0,ΣG
1,dom,cod/parenrightbig
where,
dom(Module( V)) =/circlemultiplydisplay
V′∈preG(V)V′
cod(Module( V)) =V|succG(V)|+1.(4)
It is useful to have access to parent and child information fr om a signature. The set of parent modules
of causal module v= Module( V)are given by paΣ(V) ={v′∈Σ1: cod(v′)∩dom(Module( V))/\e}atio\slash=∅}
and child modules by chΣ(V) ={v′∈Σ1: dom(v′)∩cod(Module( V))/\e}atio\slash=∅}.
2.3 Syntactic causal identiﬁcation
Here we present our main result. Richardson et al. [2012, Theorem 49] is a re-formulation of the ID
algorithm [Shpitser ,2008] for causal identiﬁcation in general causal models with lat ent variables, in
terms of ﬁxing operations on conditional ADMGs (CADMGs). In this section we provide a purely
syntactic description of the same algorithm which uses only the structural information in the ADMG.
4In the ADMGG, consider the set of causeA⊂VGand eﬀect variables Y⊂VG, whereAandY
do not intersect. Now consider the set of variables Y⋆= anGVG\A(Y)andD⋆the set of districts of
the subgraphGY⋆. The signature of the syntactic causal eﬀect ,ΣG
Y|do(A), ofAonYisidentiﬁable if,
for every district D′∈D⋆the set of nodes VG\D′is a valid ﬁxing sequence. If identiﬁable, this causal
eﬀect is given by the following composite signature manipul ation,

2.4 Signature manipulations
This section details the manipulations required to impleme nt the syntactic identiﬁcation algorithm of
(5).
Marginalization
For a chain-factored signature ΣF=/parenleftbig
ΣF
0,ΣF
1,dom,cod/parenrightbig
, the analogue of marginalization of a single
variable Vfrom a distribution over a set of variables, is given by HideV/parenleftbig
ΣF/parenrightbig
=/parenleftbig
ΣF
0,ΣF
1,dom,cod′/parenrightbig
,
where for V,
cod′(Module( V)) =V|succG(V)|(6)
andcod′= cod otherwise. For the set W={V1,...,V k}⊂VG, we extend this function to the
composite HideW= Hide V1◦···◦HideVk.
Control
Pearl’s causal interventions in ADMGs requires deleting pa rent edges [ Pearl,2009,Richardson et al. ,
2012,Bareinboim et al. ,2020]. For aﬃne SMC signatures, this entails replacing causal mo dules with
identity/copy morphisms and deleting any wires connected t o that module. This corresponds to the
signature manipulation Control V(Σ) =/parenleftbig
Σ0,Σ1,dom′,cod′/parenrightbig
,where for V,
dom′(Module( V)) =V, (7)
which replaces the module with a copied identity morphism, a nd for all other v′∈Σ1such that
v′/\e}atio\slash= Module( V),
dom′/parenleftbig
v′/parenrightbig
= dom/parenleftbig
v′/parenrightbig
cod′/parenleftbig
v′/parenrightbig
= cod/parenleftbig
v′/parenrightbig
\dom(Module( V)),(8)
where the second line deletes incoming wires using the multiset diﬀerence . This operation is extended
to controlling a set as with marginalization above.
Fixing and ﬁxing sequences
The composition of marginalization and control,
FixV= Control V◦HideV, (9)
is the syntactic analogue of ﬁxing in ADMGs [ Richardson et al. ,2012].
To ensure identiﬁability, ﬁxing can only be applied to objec ts which are ﬁxable relative to some
signature, ΣGderived from an ADMG G. Given a set of objects W={V1,...,V k}to ﬁx, we need to
determine a valid sequence of ﬁxing operations, FixseqW, for this set [ Richardson et al. ,2012]. This is
computed recursively as follows. To initialize the recursi on, setW′=W, initialize Σ = ΣG, initialize
the ﬁxing sequence operation FixseqW=id(the identity operation). The recursion step is as follows:
choose any V∈W′such that Vis ﬁxable in Σ. If there exists no such Vthen the sequence Wcannot
5have a valid ﬁxing sequence and the recursion terminates. Ot herwise, if chΣ(V) =∅then update
FixseqW/mapsto→HideV◦FixseqW, otherwise update FixseqW/mapsto→FixV◦FixseqWinstead. Now, apply
this operation to obtain the updated signature Σ/mapsto→FixseqW/parenleftbig
ΣG/parenrightbig
and delete Vfrom the ﬁxing set,
W′/mapsto→W′\V. If all objects to ﬁx have been exhausted, i.e. W′=∅, then the recursion terminates
with the ﬁxing operation sequence FixseqW, otherwise the process returns to the recursion step.
Simpliﬁcation
Manipulating a signature can lead to a causal module v= Module( V)being equivalent to the
identity morphism i.e. where dom(Module( V)) = cod(Module( V)) =V. These can be deleted
from the signature, simplifying the causal model it speciﬁe s. Writing the set of modules which are
not equivalent to a identity as W=/braceleftbig
V∈ΣG
0|(dom(Module( V))/\e}atio\slash=V)∨(cod(Module( V))/\e}atio\slash=V)/bracerightbig
,
thenDeleteId(Σ) = ( W,{Module( V′)|V′∈W},dom,cod)is the simpliﬁed signature. Furthermore,
signature manipulation can lead to a causal module having no downstream eﬀects. Such modules
can also be deleted from the signature, further simplifying the causal model. Consider the set
W={V∈Σ0|cod(Module( V))/\e}atio\slash= 1}of objects whose causal modules do not have marginalized out -
puts, then the simpliﬁed signature can be written,
Simplify(Σ) =/parenleftbig
W,/braceleftbig
Module/parenleftbig
V′/parenrightbig
|V′∈W/bracerightbig
,dom,cod′/parenrightbig
(10)
with modiﬁed codomain cod′(Module( V′)) = cod(Module( V′))\dom(Module( W′))for allV∈
Σ0\WandW′∈W.
Deleting a module might lead to other causal modules having n o downstream eﬀects, therefore it is
necessary to iterate ( 10) until a ﬁxed point signature is reached. Formally, startin g atΣ0= Σ, the
iteration Σn+1= Simplify(Σn)is repeated until some Nis obtained such that Simplify/parenleftbig
ΣN/parenrightbig
= ΣN,
whereupon we use Simple(Σ) = DeleteId/parenleftbig
ΣN/parenrightbig
as the fully simpliﬁed signature.
Combining exterior signatures
Syntactic causal identiﬁcation requires combining exteri or morphisms of manipulated signatures. For
signatures Σ1andΣ2, their combination is,
Σ = Ext/parenleftbig
Σ1/parenrightbig
∪Ext/parenleftbig
Σ2/parenrightbig
=/parenleftbig
Σ1
0∪Σ2
0,Σ1
1∪Σ2

whereExt/parenleftbig

are the signatures of the
exteriors of Σ1andΣ2respectively, and their combined codomain is,
cod′(Module( V)) =V|chΣ(V)|+1(12)
for allV∈Σ1

3 Applications
3.1 Back-door adjustment: simple case
As ﬁrst application, we show how to derive a purely syntactic account of back-door adjustment. Con-
sider a simple, fully observed model with one confounder. Th e ADMG is deﬁned by VG={X,Y,U}
and edges EG={X→Y,U→X,U→Y}, and we want the interventional signature ΣG
Y|do(X). In
this situation, the model is equivalent to a fully chain-fac tored graph so we can directly ﬁx Xin the
signature without the need for explicit district decomposi tion.
The corresponding signature ΣG=/parenleftbig
{X,Y,U},{x,y,u},/braceleftbig

so that, on application of ﬁxing, we obtain the manipulated s ignature,

,(13)
which, when simpliﬁed becomes,
Simple(Σ) = Simple/parenleftbig

u: 1→U2,x:X→X,y:XU→Y/bracerightbig/parenrightbig

{X,Y,U},{y,u},/braceleftbig
u: 1→U2,y:XU→Y/bracerightbig/parenrightbig
= ΣG
YU|do(X),(14)
and then ﬁnally marginalizing out Uwe obtain the desired interventional signature,
ΣG
Y|do(X)= Hide U/parenleftbig
{X,Y,U},{y,u},/braceleftbig
u: 1→U2,y:XU→Y/bracerightbig/parenrightbig
= ({X,Y,U},{y,u},{u: 1→U,y:XU→Y}).(15)
This is the purely syntactic categorical analogue of the wel l-known back-door adjustment formula
in this simple case. When this signature is interpreted as a M arkov category [ Fritz,2020] with con-
tinuous sample spaces X/mapsto→ΩX,U/mapsto→ΩUandY/mapsto→ΩYwith composition ·corresponding to the
Chapman-Kolmogorov equation [Little,2019,Jacobs et al. ,2021] and the causal morphisms are condi-
tional distributions u/mapsto→p(U)andy/mapsto→p(Y|X,U), then ( 15) is the interventional distribution,
p(Y=y|do(X=x)) =/integraldisplay
ΩUp(Y=y|X=x,U=u)p(U=u)du. (16)
Another interesting interpretation is in terms of the min-plus semiﬁeld Markov category [Cakiqi and Little ,
2022] for which
q(y|do(x)) = min
u∈U[q(y|x,u)+q(u)], (17)
whereu/mapsto→q(u)is aninferential bias andy/mapsto→q(y|x,u)aclique potential widely encountered in
machine learning. For these functions to be biases/potenti als, they must be normalizable in the min-
plus semiﬁeld, i.e. minu∈Uq(u) = 0 andminy∈Yq(y|x,u) = 0 [Little,2019].
3.2 Front-door adjustment
The front-door graph [ Pearl,2009] is an ADMGGgiven by VG={X,Y,Z}with edges EG=
{X→Z→Y,X↔Y}. We want the pure syntactic interventional signature ΣG
Y|do(X), which repre-
sents the causal eﬀect on Y={Y}ofA={X}. Here,VG\A={Y,Z}so thatY⋆= anG{Y,Z}({Y}) =
{Y,Z}with corresponding districts D⋆={{Y},{Z}}of subgraphG{Y,Z}(See Figure 2).The monoidal

Σ2/parenrightbig
,(21)
withModule( Z) =z, where this signature is already exterior because zis not composite. Combining
these two exterior signatures, we obtain,
ΣG
ZY|do(X)= Ext/parenleftbig
Σ1/parenrightbig
∪Ext/parenleftbig
Σ2/parenrightbig
=/parenleftbig
{X,Y,Z},{q,z},/braceleftbig
z:X→Z2,q:Z→Y/bracerightbig/parenrightbig
,(22)
and since Y⋆\Y={Y,Z}\{Y}={Z}, we obtain the desired interventional distribution by marg inal-
ization,
8ΣG
Y|do(X)= Hide {Z}/parenleftBig
ΣG
ZY|do(X)/parenrightBig
= ({X,Y,Z},{q,z},{z:X→Z,q:Z→Y}).
In practice, it may be useful to expose the interior of qand to do this we will need to relabel
x→x′(and correspondingly, X/mapsto→X′) insideqto avoid a naming clash with the interventional input
X,
ΣG
Y|do(X)=/parenleftbig/braceleftbig

As with the back-door model, this is the purely syntactic cat egorical analogue of the front-door
adjustment formula . As an example interpretation, consider the Markov categor y with discrete sample
spacesX′/mapsto→ΩX,Z/mapsto→ΩY,Y/mapsto→ΩYand with conditional distributions x′/mapsto→p(X′),z/mapsto→p(Z|X)and
y/mapsto→p(Y|X,Z), then ( 23) is the familiar discrete interventional distribution [ Pearl,2009],
p(Y=y|do(X=x)) =/summationdisplay

.(24)
Another useful interpretation are deterministic causal models in the SMC of sets and functions, in
which composition ·is ordinary function composition and ⊗is the pairing (bifunctor), with the identity
1corresponding to the empty pair (). Then, interpreting X′with the set of possible values for the
constant fX′: 1→X′, the functions fZ:X→ZandfY:X′Z→Y, the front-door interventional
model corresponding to the signature ΣG
Y|do(X)is
fY|do(X)(x) =π2(fZ(x),fY(fX′(),fZ(x)))
=fY(fX′(),fZ(x)),(25)
whereπ2is projection onto the second item of a pair.
3.3 A more complex example
Richardson et al. [2012, Example 51] describe an application of their ﬁxing theorem to a more complex
causal model with four variables and a single bidirected edg e whose latent projection ADMG Gis given
byVG={X1,X2,X3,X4}and by edge set
EG={X3←X1→X2,X2→X3,X3→X4,X2↔X4}. (26)
In this example they identify the interventional distribut ionp(X4|do(X2)). To illustrate our syn-
tactic ﬁxing algorithm for this example, we want the monoida l signature of the pure syntactic causal
eﬀect on Y={X4}ofA={X2}, i.e.ΣG
X4|do(X2). Here, VG\A={X1,X3,X4}so thatY⋆=
anGVG\A({X4}) ={X1,X3,X4}with corresponding subgraph districts D⋆=GY⋆={{X1},{X3},{X4}}.
The monoidal signature of Gis,
ΣG
0={X1,X2,X3,X4}
ΣG
1={x1,x2,x3,x4}
dom,cod =/braceleftbig
x1: 1→X3
1,x2:X1→X2
2,x3:X1X2→X2
3,x4:X1X2X3→X4/bracerightbig
,(27)
with corresponding chain-factored signature,
ΣF
0={X1,X2,X3,X4}
ΣF
1={x1,x2,x3,x4}
dom,cod =/braceleftbig
x1: 1→X4
1,x2:X1→X3
2,x3:X1X2→X2
3,x4:X1X2X3→X4/bracerightbig
.(28)
9For the district D′={X1}, the ﬁxing set is W={X2,X3,X4}, for which we obtain,
Σ1= (Simple◦FixX2◦FixX3◦FixX4)/parenleftbig
ΣF/parenrightbig
= ({X1},{x1},{x1: 1→X1})
= Ext/parenleftbig
Σ1/parenrightbig
Module( X1) =x1.(29)
For the district D′={X3}, the ﬁxing set W={X1,X2,X4}, leading to,
Σ2= (Simple◦FixX1◦FixX2◦FixX4)/parenleftbig
ΣF/parenrightbig
= ({X1,X2,X3},{x3},{x3:X1X2→X3})
= Ext/parenleftbig
Σ2/parenrightbig
Module( X3) =x3.(30)
Finally, for the district D′={X4}, the ﬁxing set W={X1,X2,X3}leads to,
Σ3= (Simple◦HideX2◦FixX3◦FixX1)/parenleftbig
ΣF/parenrightbig
=/parenleftbig
{X1,X2,X3,X4},{x4,x2},/braceleftbig
x1:X1→X2
1,x2:X1→X2,x4:X1X2X3→X4/bracerightbig/parenrightbig
,(31)
with exterior signature
Ext/parenleftbig
Σ3/parenrightbig
= ({X1,X3,X4},{q},{q:X1X3→X4}),Module( X4) =q
q=x4·(x2⊗idX1⊗idX3)·(x1⊗idX3),(32)
where the maximal exterior morphism qhas type,
dom(q) =X1X3→X1X1X3→X2→X1X3→X4= cod(q). (33)
Combining the exterior signatures obtains
ΣG
X1X3X4|do(X2)= Ext/parenleftbig
Σ1/parenrightbig
∪Ext/parenleftbig
Σ2/parenrightbig
∪Ext/parenleftbig
Σ3/parenrightbig

{X1,X2,X3,X4},{x1,x3,q},/braceleftbig
x1: 1→X3
1,x3:X1X2→X2
3,q:X1X3→X4/bracerightbig/parenrightbig
,
(34)
from which we can compute the desired, syntactic interventi onal signature by marginalization,
ΣG
X4|do(X2)= Hide {X1,X3}/parenleftBig
ΣG
X1X3X4|do(X2)/parenrightBig
=/parenleftbig
{X1,X2,X3,X4},{x1,x3,q},/braceleftbig
x1: 1→X2
1,x3:X1X2→X3,q:X1X3→X4/bracerightbig/parenrightbig
.(35)
4 Discussion
In this paper, we have shown that purely syntactic causal ide ntiﬁcation can be performed using rel-
atively simple steps. We observe that the simplicity of this approach largely arises from the process-
centric formulation of directed causal modelling and the fa ct that manipulations of this model this can
be expressed in terms of functions of the signature of the cat egory in which this model is represented.
These steps are unambiguous and therefore easily implement ed in software.
Although our approach relies on chain factorization of the o bserved process, we note that this is more
of a mathematical convenience than a restriction. An altern ative development of our approach can use
comb disintegration in place of the ﬁxing operator described here. This would lea d to diﬀerent forms
of the resulting interventional signatures which are, none theless equivalent exterior processes. Finally,
application to other, more elaborate forms of causal identi ﬁcation such as conditional causal eﬀects,
those arising through edge interventions, and more general forms of causal identiﬁcation by combining
multiple causal models, would be valuable. It would be inter esting to see the extent to which the
signature-based approach also simpliﬁes the formulation o f existing algorithms for these problems.
