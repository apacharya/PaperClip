Abstract
This study presents a comprehensive analysis of a two-patch, two-life stage SI
model without recovery from infection, focusing on the dynamics of disease
spread and host population viability in natural populations. The model, inspired
by real-world ecological crises like the decline of amphibian populations due to
chytridiomycosis and sea star populations due to Sea Star Wasting Disease, aims
to understand the conditions under which a sink host population can present
ecological rescue from a healthier, source population. Mathematical and numer-
ical analyses reveal the critical roles of the basic reproductive numbers of the
source and sink populations, the maturation rate, and the dispersal rate of juve-
niles in determining population outcomes. The study identifies conditions for
disease-free, endemic, and extinction equilibria in sink populations, emphasizing
the potential for ecological and evolutionary mechanisms to facilitate coexistence
or recovery. These findings provide insights into managing natural populations
affected by disease, with implications for conservation strategies, such as the
1arXiv:2402.06779v1  [q-bio.PE]  9 Feb 2024importance of maintaining reproductively viable refuge populations and con-
sidering the effects of dispersal and maturation rates on population recovery.
The research underscores the complexity of host-pathogen dynamics in spatially
structured environments and highlights the need for multi-faceted approaches to
biodiversity conservation in the face of emerging diseases.

1 Introduction
Many natural populations are at risk of extinction due to disease-driven mortality,
making managing these diseases a crucial endeavor to protect these species [1]. One
of the most documented cases of this population decline is the mortality of amphib-
ian populations caused by chytridiomycosis, a disease caused by the fungal pathogen
Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) [2]. More recently, sea star populations have
been declining due to the presence of an unidentified pathogen that causes the Sea
Star Wasting Disease (SSWD) [3]. Management of diseases in natural populations is a
task that requires understanding both the transmission dynamics of such diseases as
well as the population dynamics of the species studied. Ecological models that consider
the role of the transmission of infectious diseases have been studied for almost half a
century [4, 5]. Host population decline can be caused when recovery from the disease
is significantly slower than disease-induced mortality [6] or when recovery events are
rare [7]. However, classical models undermine the possibility of host populations going
extinct, observed empirically and likely caused by demographic stochasticity at low
populations or the presence of pathogen reservoirs in the environment [8].
Host population decline caused by disease-induced mortality has been observed to
vary spatially. For example, a lower transmission rate of Bd in bromeliad microhabitats
leads to higher recruitment of amphibian juveniles than in stream microhabitats [9].
In the case of SSWD, higher water temperatures in some regions potentially hinder
the immune response of the sea stars to the disease, causing increased disease-induced
mortality [10]. This spatial variation begs how disease transmission is affected when
individuals can disperse between patches. The role of mobility in disease modeling has
been recently identified as crucial to understanding the regional patterns of disease
transmission observed in data [11]. In the case of natural metapopulations, previous
analyses found that dispersal can either facilitate or dilute the transmission of the
disease [12]. Facilitation of transmission can occur due to the presence of superspreader
patches with high reproduction numbers [13], while dilution of transmission can occur
when patches with low reproduction numbers act as refugia where the population can
persist [14].
Another factor that can affect the risk of extinction due to the disease of host
populations is the stage structure of this population. Pathogens may have different
transmission rates or mortality effects on different life stages of a species [15]. Moreover,
this can cause a shift in the stage structure and reduce the population resiliency to
disturbance [16, 17]. This loss of resiliency is particularly problematic when mortality
2is higher in juvenile, nonreproductive stages. High mortality of juveniles reduces the
number of reproductive individuals and causes a population decline even when fertility
rates are high [18].
A case example of conservation interest where the risk of population extinction,
spatial variation, and life history play a role in population decline is the sunflower
sea star, Pycnopodia helianthoides [19]. This species has experienced a substantial
population decline in the Northeastern Pacific driven by increased water temperatures
and the presence of SSWD [20]. This decline has led the local population to a functional
extinction in some parts of the coastline. Pycnopodia is one of the main predators of
the barren-forming purple urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus . This decline has thus
contributed to a substantial loss of coverage of the highly productive kelp forest in
places where Pycnopodia is the main predator due to an increased grazing pressure
from purple sea urchins [21]. Furthermore, this increases the interest in recovering
Pycnopodia populations to recover kelp forest coverage [22] and promote its long-term
resistance to disturbance events [23].
In the northern extent of Pycnopodia ’s geographic range, the effect of SSWD has
been patchy [19]. Remnant populations of Pycnopodia have been found in nearshore
relatively shallow habitats within Fjords in British Columbia following regional expo-
sure to SSWD [19, 24]. In contrast, adjacent habitats considerably declined [19, 24].
Importantly, populations within Fjords have maintained a mean individual size above
the reproductive minimum. In contrast, since the SSWD outbreak, the mean size in
adjacent habitats has not reached the reproductive minimum [24]. In the years follow-
ing the SSWD outbreak, there has been consistent recruitment of juvenile Pycnopodia ,
likely sourced from the populations within the Fjords [24].
This paper presents a mathematical analysis of a two-patch, two-life stages SI
model with unidirectional dispersal and no recovery from infection. Two-patch models
are classical approaches to analyzing spatial dynamics of metapopulations mathemati-
cally. With the increasing interest in understanding spatial dynamics of disease spread,
many two-patch epidemiological models have appeared in recent literature [25–31]. In
the next section, we will introduce our model, which will then be followed by a math-
ematical and numerical analysis of its equilibria in Section 3. Finally, we will discuss
the ecological implications of our analysis in Section 4.
2 Model and methods
We propose a two-patch SI model [25] where a natural population has a density Niat
patch i= 1,2, where patch 1 represents a source patch and patch 2 is a sink patch.
On each patch, healthy adult individuals AS,iproduce healthy offspring JS,ifollowing
a logistic growth functional form. A proportion pof juveniles stay in the patch, while
the remaining 1 −pescapes the patch, either from the source patch into the sink patch
(Patch 1) or from the sink patch outside the system (Patch 2). In addition, healthy
juveniles mature and become reproductive adults at a rate α.
Healthy individuals can be infected following direct contact with an infected juve-
nileJI,ior adult AI,iwith an age-independent, patch-specific transmission rate βi.
3To model the effects of disease mortality, we separate mortality rates of healthy indi-
viduals µSfrom infected individuals µI, where the common assumption of µI> µS
is made. Finally, we model the slow or rare recovery events by assuming that no
transition from infected to susceptible individuals is possible.
In equation form, our system is written as

Remark 1. In the following section, we explore the analytical properties of this model,
particularly concerning the existence and stability criteria of equilibrium points. We

In light of this, the stability study will be performed separately for each population
patch.
3 Mathematical Analysis
3.1 First Patch Analysis
In this section, we investigate the stability and point values for the possible equilibria
of our primary model in the first patch. Note that this patch is entirely independent
of the second patch; hence, starting our analytical study with this patch alone makes
sense. There are three main types of equilibrium points possible for this patch: the
disease-free equilibrium, in which the population of infected, I1=JI,1+AI,1equals
zero, the endemic equilibrium, in which I1attains a nonzero value, and the extinc-
tion equilibrium, in which all values, JS,1, AS,1, JI,1andAI,1converge to zero (the
5population becomes extinct). We investigate the possible parameters for each scenario
that control the point’s stability.
3.1.1 Disease-free equilibrium for the first patch
After some calculations, if J1is the Jacobian matrix for the first patch, then we have
that det( J1−λI) is given by

When we find ourselves in the disease-free equilibrium for this patch, we have JI,1=
AI,1= 0, implying that δ1=η1= 0 and ϑ1=1
N1. Substituting these values in the
determinant (3) we must compute

,
which is a product of two quadratic polynomials. We simplify both of them. For the
second polynomial, note that when the system attains the disease-free-equilibrium we
have that N1=JS,1+AS,1so the second polynomial becomes
−β1
N1(µI+λ)(AS,1+JS,1) + (µI+λ)2=−β1(µI+λ) + (µI+λ)2=
(µI+λ)(−β1+µI+λ) = (µI+λ)(λ−(β1−µI)).
The reader can verify that the first polynomial is of the form λ2+B1λ+C1where
B1>0 and C1>0, so both of it’s roots are negative1. In conclusion, the characteristic
polynomial of the Jacobian matrix at the disease-free equilibrium is of the form
(λ2+B1λ+C1)(µI+λ)(λ−(β1−µI)),
1Indeed, in equation ax2+bx+c= 0,where a, b, c > 0, then one possible root has numerator −b−√
b2−4acwhich is negative, and the other has numerator −b+√
b2−4acwhich is also negative: −b+√
b2−4ac < 0⇔√
b2−4ac < b ⇔b2−4ac < b2⇔0<4ac.
6with the following eigenvalues: λ1, λ2(the two negative roots of λ2+B1λ+C1), -µI
andβ1−µI. Consequently, the disease-free equilibrium in this patch is stable when
β1< µ I. This leads us to define the basic reproductive number for the first
patch , given by
R0,1:=β1
µI. (5)
We then have the following.
Proposition 1. When R0,1<1, the disease-free equilibrium in the first patch is stable.
Remark 2. The disease-free equilibrium can be computed explicitly as well, and a
simple calculation shows that it is given by

3.1.2 Endemic equilibrium for the first patch
Consider the variable I1:=JI,1+AI,1, the total infected population in the first
patch of the model. We find the existence of equilibria where I1>0. The appendix’s
calculations in section B give us the following proposition regarding this endemic
equilibria.
Proposition 2. If the first patch of the model (1) attains an endemic equilibrium,
then it is given by

Provided that I∗
1>0and that R0,1>12.
Remark 3. Let us carefully analyze Equation (9). The reader will note that, looking
atR0,1as a variable, there are three roots for I∗
1= 0, given by:
R0,1= 1,

The second root is always less than 1. However, the third root can be greater or less than
1. Both cases yield very different situations, as shown in our numerical simulations
below.
3.1.3 Extinction equilibrium for the first patch
Another type of equilibrium that might be present in this model is the extinction
equilibrium. It is simple to verify that the determinant at (3), when AS,1=JS,1=
AI,1=JI,1= 0 equals ( µI+λ)2(µS+λ)(λ+α+µS), which has all negative roots.
Moreover, this implies that the extinction equilibrium is stable. This equilibrium will
be attained when R0,1>1 and I∗
1in equation (9) is negative. Again, this will be
discussed more in-depth in our numerical results section.
3.2 Second Patch Analysis
We now continue with a similar analysis of the equilibria possibilities for the second
patch. Note that this patch is dependent on the first due to the presence of the term
AS,1in the first equation of the second patch. Consequently, results for this patch will
also depend on the equilibrium point attained by the first patch.
3.2.1 Disease-free equilibrium for the second patch
The Jacobian matrix of the second patch, J2, is analogous to J1, with the exception
that each entry of the first row has the addition of the extra term −(1−p)r
kAS,1. Calcu-
lations made in section C of the appendix assure us that the determinant det( J2−λI)
is again of the form
(λ2+B2λ+C2)(µI+λ)(λ−(β2−µI)),
where B2, C2>0. This yields a similar situation as in the first patch, where the
disease-free equilibrium in the second patch is stable when β2< µI. Again this obliges
us to define the basic reproductive number for the second patch , given by
R0,2:=β2
µI. (11)
We have thus proved the following.
Proposition 3. When R0,2<1, the disease-free equilibrium in the second patch is
stable.
83.2.2 Endemic equilibria for the second patch
The endemic equilibria in the second patch are those equilibria points in which I2:=
JI,2+AI,2is positive. The only difference with the corresponding analysis for the first
patch consists of an extra term that depends on AS,1andN2for the first equation in
this patch. We recall that this equation is given at the equilibrium point by

the second patch, to obtain the relations

Proposition 4. When the first patch attains an equilibrium ( J∗

4 Numerical Analysis
Example 1 (First Patch Analysis) .Remark 3 indicates that the analysis of the equilib-
rium of the first patch depends highly on the values of the roots of the cubic polynomial
that defines I∗
1in terms of the basic reproductive number for the first patch, R0,1. The
following graphs show disease-free and endemic equilibria at the first patch when the
9third root of this polynomial is greater than 1. We highlight the type of equilibrium
attained at each region.

Fig. 2 Final infected (red) and susceptible (blue) proportions attained in both patches, varying
values of R0,1. Keeping the value of R0,2constant, with R0,2>1. Note that when R0,1<1, the
disease-free equilibrium for the first patch is stable. When R0,1>1, this equilibrium is not stable;
this leads to an endemic equilibrium, given by the theoretical value of I∗
1in proposition (2). However,
for larger values of R0,1, the value of I∗
1becomes negative, so the system converges to the extinction
equilibrium.
In the scenario of Figure (2), the third root (for I∗
1= 0) of the polynomial in
Equation (9) is greater than 1, giving us an interval 1< R 0,1<1 +ϵin which I∗
1>0,
which yields the region for the endemic equilibrium. When the third root is less than 1,
no such interval exists, and the system only has two possibilities: if R0<1, it attains
a disease-free equilibrium, and if R0>1, it attains the extinction equilibrium. This
case is rather extreme and can be achieved, for example, with very low values of the
parameter α.
Example 2 (Second Patch Analysis) .While the first patch is independent and only
affected by its reproductive number R0,1, the second patch is affected by the behavior
of both patches as an aggregate. In this situation, the equilibria attained by the second
patch are influenced by the value of R0,1andR0,2. Figure (3) shows this relationship.
10Each point represents the average equilibrium point attained by the system using the
corresponding values of (R0,1, R0,2)for several simulations with different initial condi-
tions. With disease parameters r= 1, k= 1, α= 0.6, µS= 0.1, µI= 0.1andp= 0.5.
As shown before, when R0,2<1, the disease-free equilibrium is stable in the second
patch. When R0,2>1the equilibrium depends on both R0,1andR0,2. The region on
the bottom right represents an extinction scenario for larger values of both R0,1and
R0,2. A range of R0,2values yields endemic equilibria in the second patch, regardless
of the R0,1value.

Example 3 (Stability of the general endemic equilibrium) .Computing the eigenval-

To inspect the stability of these points, we perform simulations and present the maxi-
mum eigenvalues of these Jacobian matrices at the endemic equilibrium scenarios. The
results of this experiment are presented in Figure 4 for each patch. When R0,1<1or
R0,2<1, the corresponding disease-free equilibria are stable (as proved before). When
R0,1andI∗
1>0according to Equation (9), then the corresponding endemic equilib-
rium seems to be also stable for all simulations performed. In the ultimate case, the
extinction equilibrium is also stable.

Example 4 (Equilibria in terms of other variables) .Equation (9) serves as a basis to
determine the type of equilibrium that is to be achieved by the system. When I∗
1<0,
the endemic equilibrium is not feasible, so the system will either attain a disease-free
or an extinction equilibrium, depending on the values of the reproductive numbers R0,1
andR0,1. Equation (9) depends on virtually all disease parameters, and many yield
interesting bifurcation results.
Figure (5) shows the effects of pand the maturation rate αas bifurcation param-
eters for this system. The full impact of α, pandR0,2into the infected equilibrium
of patch two is displayed in Figure (6). We note that these parameters determine the
existence of each equilibrium type. In general, low values of pandα, orpclose to 1,
are cases that lead to the extinction equilibrium for the second patch.

5 Discussion
In this paper, we explored the different dynamics of a two-patch metapopulation with
a disease where recovery is impossible, and dispersal occurs in a single direction from a
source population to a sink population. We mathematically proved the different fates
of the sink population as a function of the independent basic reproduction numbers for
the source R0,1(Equation 5) and sink populations R0,2(Equation 11). We numerically
explored these different fates (Figure 3) and found that when both basic reproduction
numbers are smaller than 1, a global disease-free equilibrium occurs. As the basic
reproduction numbers for the sink population R0,2crosses the one threshold, the sink
population presents an endemic equilibrium, where the population coexists with the
disease. This is the only scenario we numerically found for intermediate values of
R0,2>1. However, for higher R0,2values, the sink population reaches extinction if
the source population is highly infectious by having a high basic reproduction number
R0,1.
The endemic equilibrium we found in our model represents a coexistence between
the host population and its disease. This coexistence can occur through several mech-
anisms. Our results are consistent with mechanisms such as increased resistance and
tolerance to the pathogen and the presence of environmental refugia [32]. As the resis-
tance and tolerance to the pathogen in a given patch iincreases, its transmission
rateβidecreases, and thus its basic reproduction number R0,idecreases as well. This
increases the likelihood of the sink population escaping the extinction equilibrium. A
source patch with a healthy population can also act as a refugia where the sink pop-
ulation is sustained through recruitment inputs. This can allow the sink population
to persist as the proportion of juveniles that go to the sink patch pincreases over a
certain threshold at high basic reproduction number R0,2values.
However, whether the juveniles from the source patch can produce a self-sustaining
population in the sink patch or the population is only sustained by the recruitment
15inputs depends on how many productive adults are in the sink population at equilib-
rium. Looking at the stage structure of the equilibrium population in the sink patch,
measured by its ratio of juveniles to adultsJ∗
S,2
A∗
S,2hints at whether this population is
dominated by productive adults or juveniles, potentially arriving from the source pop-
ulation to die (Figure 7). We found that when an endemic equilibrium is reached in
the sink patch, the likelihood of having an ecological rescue, where the juveniles man-
age to become productive adults (i.e., a smaller juvenile to adult ratio) depends only
on the maturation rate αand not on the proportion of juveniles that reach the sink
patch p. This is consistent with other empirical and modeling efforts that have shown
a higher production rate of reproductive individuals promotes eco-evolutionary rescue
[33, 34].
In the study, the infection dynamics in the second patch of a two-patch SI epidemic
model are closely tied to the variable A∗
S,1, representing the number of susceptible
adults in the first patch. The relationship between the infection level in the second
patch and A∗
S,1is governed by the quadratic equation (15). This equation underscores
how the infection level in the second patch is influenced not only by the internal
dynamics of that patch but also significantly by the number of susceptible adults in
the first patch. This inter-patch dependency is further modulated by the basic repro-
ductive number R0,2of the second patch, indicating a complex interplay between the
two patches. This aspect of the model underscores a critical insight into the dynamics
of infectious diseases in multi-patch environments, highlighting the necessity of con-
sidering inter-patch interactions for a comprehensive understanding of disease spread
and control in spatially structured populations.
With the wide geographical spread of SSWD and the lack of documented resistance
to disease in Pycnopodia , the question of whether these populations could recover is
open. These modeling results suggest that reproductively viable refuge populations
within a region could sustain nearby populations, assuming that host reproductive
output is high enough. While the models were developed with natural populations
in mind, these modeling results could inform the efficacy of different management
actions suggested in the roadmap to recovery for the Pycnopodia [35]. In particular,
a captive breeding program intending to outplant lab-raised Pycnopodia would create
similar unidirectional recruitment/outplanting dynamics. With the continued low level
of SSWD infection found in the surviving sea star populations across the range [36],
outplanting will be conducted where the disease is still present in the environment.
Additionally, our model suggests increased infected mortality with strategies such
as selective culling. However, this has not been found to improve infection rates in nat-
ural populations and compensate for the disease mortality [37, 38]. With Pycnopodia
being considered for listing with the Endangered Species Act in the US [24], and under
review by COSEWIC in Canada [35], the need for informed management actions is
high.
An aspect of these dynamics that are not explored in our model is the possibility
of resistance to the disease evolving in the population [39]. Populations may evolve
an increased recovery rate where recovery is not rare, and the recovery dynamics
cannot be ignored [40]. In addition, dispersal of individuals with higher pathogen
resistance could promote the persistence of the population in highly infectious patches
16through an evolutionary rescue effect rather than only through an ecological rescue
effect [41]. Evolutionary rescue is one of the primary mechanisms to promote host-
pathogen coexistence and can be further explored with an eco-evolutionary model
[42].
In addition to species adaptation, our model considers a simple spatial structure
where the metapopulation follows source-sink dynamics. In reality, species may be
distributed in various spatial configurations, with patches of different quality regarding
transmission rate. In these cases, increased interaction between patches (either through
a higher dispersal of juveniles or patch connectedness) may lead to higher mortality,
but endemic equilibria should still exist [43]. In addition, some patches may act as
refugia where the disease is not present, or transmission is low enough that a disease-
free equilibrium is achievable [14]. These previous empirical and theoretical studies
suggest that our results on species persistence would still be valid for more complex
spatial topologies.
In conclusion, our analysis showed the conditions for a sink host population to
persist in the presence of an unrecoverable disease. We focus our numerical exploration
on juveniles’ maturation rate and dispersal rate as these were inspired by the specific
case of Pycnopodia management. A possible extension to generalize the results of this
model is a two-patch model where bidirectional dispersal (potentially asymmetric) is
possible.
