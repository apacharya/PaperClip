Th is can only be achieved with a quantitative platform that can \\ncomprehensively deduce and relate protein stru cture, functional, a nd evolution of genomes \\nand proteomes in a comparative f ashion.  Were this perfected, proper analyses would start to \\nuncover the underlying physical laws governing th e emergent behavior of biological systems \\nand the evolutionary pressures responsible for func tional innovation.  In the near term, such \\nmethodology would allow the vast  quantities of uncharacterized (e.g. metagenomic samples) \\nprimary amino acid sequences to be rapidly deco ded.

Th e main purpose of that book,\\ntentatively entitled The Art of Computer Programming , was to explain how to write compilers;\\ncompilation was to bethe subject of the twelfth and ﬁnal chap ter. Chapter 10 was called “Parsing,”\\nand Chapter 11 was “The theory of languages.” I wrote the draf ts of these chapters in the order\\n11, 10, 12, because Chapter 11 was the most fun to do.\\nTerminology and notation for formal linguistics were in a gr eat state of ﬂux in the early 60s,\\nso it was natural for me to experiment with new ways to deﬁne th e notion of what was then being\\ncalled a “Chomsky type 2” or “ALGOL-like” or “deﬁnable” or “p hrase structure” or “context-free”'],\n",
